1,Viet Nam,Vietnam: blogger sentenced to 8-year jail term (Update),14/05/2023,"A court in Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City on Friday sentenced war veteran and democracy activist Tran Van Bang to eight years in prison and three years probation for Facebook posts that were deemed to be anti-state propaganda in a trial that lasted less than three hours.

Tran Van Bang, better known as Tran Bang, is a 62-year-old war veteran who fought during the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War. He had regularly participated in demonstrations against China for its controversial claims over territories in the South China Sea. 

He was arrested in March 2022 for what was initially determined to be 31 Facebook posts between March 2016 and August 2021. 

After a subsequent investigation, authorities found that he wrote 39 problematic posts between three Facebook accounts that that were seen as “distorting, defaming and speaking badly of the people’s government; providing false information, causing confusion among the people; and expressing hate and discontent towards the authorities, Party, State, and country’s leaders,” the Tuoi Tre newspaper reported, citing the indictment.

The posts were in violation of article 117 of the penal code, a vague law that the government has often used to silence dissent.

It was the latest conviction in Hanoi’s ongoing campaign to silence bloggers and activists. Vietnam has convicted at least 60 such people under the same article and sentenced them between four and 15 years in prison, and 13 others to between four and 12 years under the older article 88, because it was the law when the alleged crime occurred, New York-based Human Rights Watch reported.

During Friday’s trial, Bang claimed that his Facebook accounts had been hacked and he hadn’t used them in a very long time. 

But the Procuracy rejected the explanation, and used the posts on the accounts to convict him.

Tran Dinh Dung, Bang’s defense lawyer, told RFA’s Vietnamese Service following the trial that freedom of speech is guaranteed in Article 25 of Vietnam’s constitution, and Article 117 does not explain anti-state propaganda.

“The current law fails to clarify what freedom of speech is and what anti-state propaganda is,” said Dung. “In addition, there are some electronic documents and evidence missing, so I requested that the file of the case should be returned to the procuracy and a verdict should only be made when everything was clarified.”

Closed trial

Two diplomats, from the U.S. and France, were barred from attending the proceedings. They were made to wait in the courtyard until the trial’s conclusion. 

Family members, meanwhile, were allowed only to watch the proceedings on a television screen from another room in the courthouse.

Bang’s brother, who declined to be named, told RFA that the audio of the broadcast was cut several times when the defense lawyer was speaking and was turned very low when Bang spoke in his own defense. 

“The lawyer requested an additional investigation as some assessments of the investigator about the Facebook stories, which were the ground for accusations, were wrong,” Bang’s brother said. 

“The lawyer also said that the accusation grounds were just the investigator’s viewpoint, and with another viewpoint, other people may find my brother innocent.”

According to Dung, his client will appeal the verdict. He told the judging panel that Bang was suffering from a serious health issue as he had a tumor in the groin area, which had not been determined benign or malignant. The verdict noted this information but also said that it needed to wait for the opinion of Bang’s detention center clinics, Dung said.

“On May 10, I had a working session with the detention center, and they told me that their clinic had recommended removing the tumor,” said Dung, adding that red tape is preventing the operation. “If the tumor is malignant, i.e. cancer, it would be a very serious health issue.”

Human Rights Watch on Thursday issued a media release calling on the Vietnamese government to drop all charges against Bang and immediately release him.",Right to liberty and security
2,China,China: pro-democracy defender sentenced in closed-door trial (Update),14/05/2023,"China sentenced lawyer and prominent rights activist Guo Feixiong to a prison term of eight years on Thursday, with diplomats from several countries saying they were barred from the trial in the southern city of Guangzhou.

The sentence follows terms of more than a decade in jail each handed to two prominent rights lawyers, Ding Jiaxi and Xu Zhiyong in April, amid China's clampdown on dissent since President Xi Jinping came to power in 2012.

While rights groups say hundreds of lawyers and activists have been detained in recent years, China says it respects the rule of law and individual rights and rejects criticism of its human rights record.

Guo, 58, has drawn international attention for campaigns against issues such as graft and censorship, and his accusations of mistreatment by Chinese authorities during more than a decade behind bars on previous charges.

His latest detention, in 2022, came a year after he was stopped from leaving the country to visit his dying wife in the United States, sparking further outcry.

After a three-hour trial Guo, whose real name is Yang Maodong, was found guilty of defaming China's political system and inciting subversion of state power, his brother said in a statement, adding that Guo would appeal against the judgment.

Thursday's statement was confirmed by Guo's lawyer.

Diplomats from several countries said they were prevented from attending the trial.

""Today, U.S. diplomats were blocked from attending the court proceedings of Guo Feixiong,"" the U.S. embassy in China said on its Twitter account. ""We continue to call for Mr. Guo's speedy release so he may be reunited with his family.""

Diplomats from Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, and the Netherlands were also turned away and told by a court clerk that foreign visitors needed approval from higher authorities, four diplomats told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

The Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court and China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In early 2021, Guo was stopped by officials at the airport in the commercial hub of Shanghai as he sought to visit his ailing wife in the United States.

His public pleas to be allowed to leave were rebuffed and his wife died of cancer about a year later. Two days after that, Guo was arrested by Guangzhou police and has been held in detention since, according to rights groups.

Guo was subjected to ""years of mistreatment, imprisonment, routine harassment and surveillance, and denied foreign travel for his peaceful advocacy on behalf of the Chinese people,"" the U.S. state department has said earlier.",Right to fair trial

4,Thailand,Thailand 9 arrested for taking part in demonstration,15/05/2023,"9 activists were arrested during a protest at Samranrat Police Station on the afternoon of 10 May to demand the release of 15-year-old activist Thanalop Phalanchai.

The protest took place after the police filed more charges against Thanalop, now detained pending trial on a royal defamation charge at the Ban Pranee Juvenile Vocational Training Centre for Girls in Nakhon Pathom.

Officers from Samranrat Police Station went to Ban Pranee to inform Thanalop of the charges without informing her guardian or lawyer. They also brought a woman who they claimed was a lawyer they had appointed for Thanalop.

Activist Anna Annanon, who was visiting Thanalop, livestreamed the officers' visit on Facebook. When she asked the officers if they had informed activist Sopon Surariddhidhamrong, Thanalop's guardian, that they were filing more charges against her, they said that they had told the ""human rights lawyer.""

Anna also asked the alleged lawyer for her name, but she refused to answer and threatened to file charges against Anna under the Personal Data Protection Act for livestreaming the officers' visit.

Anna said that she was visiting Thanalop with other activists and was about to leave but decided to stay when they saw officers from Samranrat Police Station arriving at Ban Pranee. She said that, in the end, the police left without seeing Thanalop.

Meanwhile, a protest took place at Samranrat Police Station. Activists threw red paint onto the police station building and onto the household spirit shrine in front of the building. They also demanded that Pol Col Thotsaphon Amphaiphiphatkun, superintendent of Samranrat Police Station, explain why officers visited Thanalop to notify her of her charges without notifying her guardian.

They also demanded the 15-year-old's release, saying that it is within the police and the court's power to release Thanalop so she can return to school. 

Pol Maj Gen Nakarin Sukonthawit, commander of the Metropolitan Police Division 6, came to the police station and told the activists that the officers were only doing their job by informing Thanalop of further charges. He also insisted that Thanalop's parents file a bail request for her

After Pol Maj Gen Nakarin went inside the police station building, activists threw coloured smoke flares up the steps in front of the police station.

A small clash then occurred after activist Tantawan Tuatulanon went to the police station door to demand that a representative of the police come to speak to the media. The activists tried to push through the police barrier but were pushed out, and the glass door of the police station was broken during the clash.

At around 18.55, several units of crowd control police in normal khaki uniforms arrived at the police station. 10 minutes later, they blocked the entrance to the police station with shields as the activists tried to go back up the steps.

Meanwhile, Tantawan continued to demand that Pol Col Thotsaphon come out to speak to them and said that the police had ruined Thanalop's future by detaining her and keeping her from going to school. Another protester also threw objects at the officers, starting another clash, during which officers pulled Tantawan inside the police station.

Activist Orawan Phuphong was also arrested while shouting at the officers for injuring her during the clash, after the police ordered them to leave the police station and crowd control police blocked the entrance to the police station.

A total of 9 activists were arrested: Sittichai Prasai, Natthaphon Lekyaem, Suttawee Soikham, Noppasin Treelayapewat, Thiraphat Pradapkaeo, Jirapas Koram, Ronnakorn Hangchaicharoen, Tantawan Tuatulanon, and Orawan Phuphong.

The activists were separated and moved from Samranrat Police Station to three other police stations. Sittichai, Natthaphon, and Suttawee were taken to Chalongkrung Police Station. Noppasin, Thiraphat, Jirapas, and Ronnakorn were taken to Lat Krabang Police Station. Tantawan and Orawan were taken to Thung Song Hong Police Station.

At around 21.00, Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR) said their lawyers had gone to the three police stations. At Lat Krabang Police Station, Noppasin and the three other activists told the lawyer they were beaten while being arrested.

Meanwhile, at Thung Song Hong Police Station, TLHR said that Tantawan and Orawan have been separated, with Tantawan being placed in a men's jail cell. In protest, they tied their bras around their own necks, and after officers took their bras from them, Orawan banged her head against the cell wall.

Tantawan told her lawyer that Pol Col Thotsaphon flashed his middle finger at the activists while they were detained, and that an officer named Siriphong Kongkaeo hit Orawan's hand with the keys to the jail cell and pulled Tantawan's head while threatening them.

TLHR reported that because the activists' phones were confiscated and the officers did not tell them on what charges they were being arrested, Orawan stripped naked as a form of civil disobedience, and that women crowd control officers took videos of Orawan while she was naked.

At Chalongkrung Police Station, lawyers were not allowed to see the three activists detained there, claiming that they needed to wait for every detainee's lawyer to arrive. TLHR noted that it is a violation of the detainee's right, since they have the right to see their own lawyer and no law requires that lawyers have to wait as the police claimed.

TLHR said that Tantawan and Orawan sustained minor injuries while being arrested. Tantawan has cuts and bruises on her hands from being dragged inside Samranrat Police Station, while Orawan has bruises on her legs from being forced inside a police car, as well as cuts on her hands and bruises on her neck from tying herself to the cell bars using her bra.",Freedom of assembly

TLHR reported that because the activists' phones were confiscated and the officers did not tell them on what charges they were being arrested, Orawan stripped naked as a form of civil disobedience, and that women crowd control officers took videos of Orawan while she was naked.

At Chalongkrung Police Station, lawyers were not allowed to see the three activists detained there, claiming that they needed to wait for every detainee's lawyer to arrive. TLHR noted that it is a violation of the detainee's right, since they have the right to see their own lawyer and no law requires that lawyers have to wait as the police claimed.

TLHR said that Tantawan and Orawan sustained minor injuries while being arrested. Tantawan has cuts and bruises on her hands from being dragged inside Samranrat Police Station, while Orawan has bruises on her legs from being forced inside a police car, as well as cuts on her hands and bruises on her neck from tying herself to the cell bars using her bra.",Right to liberty and security
5,Pakistan,Pakistan: media workers beaten by police for filming a raid,15/05/2023,"Pakistan authorities and the leadership and supporters of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party must respect the rights of journalists covering the country’s political unrest, the Committee to Protect Journalists said Friday.

Amid protests following the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday, May 9, authorities and supporters of Khan’s PTI party have repeatedly attacked and harassed members of the press, according to a statement by the local press freedom group Pakistan Press Foundation and local journalists who spoke to CPJ. On Thursday, Pakistan’s Supreme Court declared Khan’s arrest illegal and ordered his immediate release.

As of the evening of Friday, May 12, at least one journalist, Imran Riaz Khan, was being held in an unidentified location, his lawyer Mian Ali Ashfaq told CPJ by phone.

The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority has also suspended mobile internet services and restricted access to Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter in various areas throughout the country since Tuesday.

“Pakistan authorities must unconditionally release journalist Imran Riaz Khan, investigate all attacks on the media, and restore unrestricted access to internet services and social media platforms throughout the country,” said Carlos Martinez de la Serna, CPJ’s program director. “The Pakistani people have a right to be informed about the ongoing upheaval in their country. The authorities and the opposition political party must respect that right.”

Authorities arrested Imran Riaz Khan, an anchor with the privately owned broadcaster BOL News, in the early hours of Thursday, May 11, at Punjab’s Sialkot Airport, where he was scheduled to travel to Oman, according to news reports and Ashfaq.

In a detention order reviewed by CPJ, the Sialkot police accused the journalist of repeatedly delivering “provocative speech” and requested that he be detained for 30 days due to the “likelihood that he will create unrest [among] the general public and create [a] law & order situation.”

Prior to his arrest, the journalist had published videos on his personal YouTube channel, where he has about 4 million subscribers, demonstrating support for PTI protesters and sharing reports alleging that the former prime minister had been tortured in custody.

Attacks by police

At about 2:30 a.m. on Wednesday, police officers attacked Feezan Ashraf, a producer for the privately owned broadcaster Suno TV, and Syed Mustajab Hassan, a producer for the privately owned broadcaster Express News, while they were attempting to cover a raid on the home of a PTI leader in Rawalpindi, according to a statement by the National Press Club in Islamabad, which CPJ reviewed, and the two journalists, who spoke with CPJ by phone.

Six police officers confronted Ashraf and Hassan, who introduced themselves as journalists and showed the officers their press identification cards. However, the officers proceeded to kick, slap, and beat the journalists with wooden rods for about 15 minutes, they said, adding that officers also broke their mobile phones and forced Hassan to delete a video he captured of the raid.

Ashraf and Hassan sustained significant lesions throughout their bodies and painful injuries, including to their heads, according to the journalists and photos of their injuries reviewed by CPJ. They received treatment at a local hospital and were prescribed painkillers.

Separately, at around 3 a.m. on Thursday, five police officers detained Aftab Iqbal, an anchor with the privately owned broadcaster Samaa TV, at his farmhouse in Lahore, according to a video by the journalist’s wife, Nasreen Iqbal, and Ashfaq, who is also representing Iqbal.

While entering the home’s premises, officers pushed a security guard to the ground, slapped Iqbal’s assistant, and threatened others at the scene to lie down or be shot, Nasreen Iqbal said in that video, adding that her husband did not resist his arrest.

Iqbal had also published videos on YouTube, where he has 1.6 million followers, that showed his support for PTI protesters and Imran Khan. Iqbal was released on Friday following an order by the Lahore High Court, Ashfaq said.

CPJ called and messaged Lahore Capital City Police Officer Bilal Kamyana and emailed the Punjab police for comment but did not immediately receive any replies.",Right to healthy and safe environment
6,Pakistan,Pakistan: media workers attacked while covering protests,15/05/2023,"In the wake of the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan on May 9, freedom of expression in Pakistan has suffered significant setbacks as internet shutdowns, attacks and detainment of journalists and media workers have swept the country. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) and its affiliate, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), condemn the attacks on media workers and urge the Pakistani government to apprehend the perpetrators to protect working journalists.

In the days following the arrest of Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder and former Prime Minister Imran Khan, authorities have restricted access across the country to social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, with total internet shutdowns experienced in Islamabad and other cities.  

On May 9, during ongoing protests against Khan's arrest, Nisar Ali Khan, the chief executive of Chhachh News Network, was pelted with stones by PTI workers in Lahore. Khan suffered injuries across his body, including a gash on his forehead and severe bleeding. Despite further threats from protestors, intervention by journalist Malik Asif stopped any further attacks on the journalist. Khan was taken to Tehsil Headquarters Hospital to receive medical attention with assistance from his colleagues.  

In Peshawar, PTI employees attacked a Dawn News team on May 9, targeting and injuring reporter Arfi Hayat and network media workers. The assailants damaged the crew’s cameras and vehicle, breaking one window, and a side mirror, and creating a large crack in the windscreen. The PTI workers similarly vandalised equipment and vehicles from Express News and Khyber News.

8,Kazakhstan,Kazakhstan: two defenders sentenced to 15-day jail for protest,15/05/2023,"Held a protest, detained, released, detained again

Vlada Yermolcheva has been demonstrating with a poster stating “We were robbed of elections” in the central pedestrian street in Almaty on March 26, a week after the parliamentary election. She was swiftly detained that day, but later released. On May 6, police officers approached her in a cafe and demanded she follow them to a police station. On the night to May 7, she was found guilty of a violation of Article 488(7) of the Code of Administrative Offences of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

Darkhan Sharipov has also been detained for a protest on November 20, 2022. On the day of the presidential election, a group of activists unfurled a banner reading “Will we live to (see) fair elections?” on the main square in Almaty. All were detained by the police in less than ten minutes and released the same day without charge. On May 7, the night court found Sharipov guilty of a violation of Article 488(6). 
Police and court violated the procedure

In his interview to The Village Kazakhstan Yermolcheva’s attorney, Talgat Miyermanov, pointed out numerous procedural violations. No document stating the time and date of Yermolcheva’s first detention in March has been provided in the court materials. The detention report is dated 27 March – a day after the initial detention – but includes information from 19 April. Moreover, possible penalties stated in the law include a fine, an arrest is imposed only in exceptional cases – for instance, when a person has a previous conviction. The court, however, chose the harshest punishment – arrest with the maximum term, despite the fact that Yermolcheva had no criminal record.
Penalties for peaceful assembly without permission

Kazakhstan’s law “On Peaceful Assemblies”  is heavily criticised by civil society for violating the right of peaceful assembly. While the Constitution grants the right to peacefully gather to all Kazakhstani citizens, and the Law states that it is sufficient to inform local authorities without obtaining explicit permission to organise a demonstration, in fact there is a very limited space where such gatherings could be held, and the organisers need to “book” them in advance by the same city council, who has the ability to veto the assembly. For the mobile demonstrations such as rallies, notification is not enough – one has to apply for a written approval of the authorities.

Human rights defender Tatiana Chernobil, commented to Novastan on why the authorities acted so long after the pickets took place, says one can be held liable within one year after the peaceful assembly itself.

“This law prohibits the holding of peaceful assemblies without the so-called sanction of the Akimat (city council), – explains Chernobil. – Pickets under this law are considered to be peaceful assemblies, which means that holding them, the same as with other peaceful assemblies, without notification and, importantly, without obtaining the necessary reciprocal approval of the Akimat will be illegal.

Darkhan and Vlada held their actions without notifying the Akimat out of principle, rightfully believing that holding of solitary pickets should not require the approval of the authorities. Fair enough because these are international human rights standards. But our government and the law believe otherwise. Therefore, holding even single pickets without Akimat approval in Kazakhstan is fraught with penalties.

What is interesting is that, in general, the limitation period for administrative responsibility established by the Code of Administrative Offences is 2 months, but a special period of 1 year is established for violating the legislation on peaceful assemblies.

It is also interesting to see what other administrative offences have such a long limitation period of 1 year. These are ‘corruption offences, unlawful interference of officials into entrepreneurial activity and also for offences in the sphere of inspections of private enterprise and other forms of control and supervision with visits to private enterprise, taxation, environment protection, protection of competition, customs, legislation on pension provision, on obligatory social insurance, on energy saving and improvement of energy efficiency, on state secrets, on natural monopolies, subsoil and subsoil use.’ This is the kind of company that peaceful assemblies find themselves in,” – concludes Chernobil.
Verdict upheld

On May 11, after Yermolcheva’s verdict was upheld in the court of appeal, she declared she is going on a hunger strike.

In his letter from detention center, Darkhan Sharipov sends warm greetings to his fellow activists: “You must not be ashamed for your civic position; the president and the state must be ashamed of imprisoning citizens for dissent.

9,Kyrgyzstan,Kyrgyzstan: media worker summoned for questioning,15/05/2023,"Kyrgyz authorities should let the independent news website PolitKlinika work free from fear of legal harassment, the Committee to Protect Journalists said Thursday.

On May 6, officers with Kyrgyzstan’s State Committee for National Security, or SCNS, summoned PolitKlinika founder and chief editor Dilbar Alimova for questioning about a May 5 article published by the outlet, according to news reports and Alimova, who spoke to CPJ by phone.

Alimova told CPJ that she was outside the capital city of Bishkek at the time, and authorities demanded she return immediately, or they would come with a summons and take her to the city for questioning. However, after she posted about the call on social media, SCNS officers agreed to ask her questions by phone.

The officers did not make it clear why the SCNS was looking into that article, which reported on a letter allegedly written by the speaker of Kyrgyzstan’s parliament to the prosecutor-general, Alimova said, adding that the head of the SCNS was a close political ally of the speaker. The officers asked her about the letter and where the outlet got it from.

After the publication of that article, the speaker’s press secretary said the letter was “fake” and threatened to apply for PolitKlinika’s website to be blocked under Kyrgyzstan’s law on false information unless the outlet deleted its report.

“Alongside their forced closure of RFE/RL’s local service, Kyrgyz authorities seem to have embarked on a systematic course of undermining and intimidating independent media into silence,” said Gulnoza Said, CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia program coordinator, in New York. “Kyrgyz authorities must stop summoning journalists for interrogation over their reporting, and should allow Dilbar Alimova and PolitKlinika to work freely.”

PolitKlinika publishes fact-checking reports, political news, and investigations, those news reports said.

On Monday, May 8, PolitKlinika issued a statement saying the outlet stood by its reporting and noted that it had included a statement from the parliamentary office denying the letter’s authenticity, and had also reached out to the prosecutor-general for comment. The outlet said it was temporarily taking the report down pending a response from the prosecutor-general.

Alimova told CPJ that she felt there was “colossal pressure” on independent media by Kyrgyz authorities, pointing to the April 2023 shuttering of U.S. Congress-funded broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s local service Radio Azattyk. 

Separately, on February 20, Kyrgyz state broadcaster EITR filed a lawsuit against PolitKlinika and Tynystan Asypbek, a reporter at the outlet, demanding 10 million som (US$115,000) in damages over a February 3 video report alleging that ElTR had made false claims about government borrowing, according to news reports.

Alimova told CPJ that the ongoing court case – in which the state-run channel is seeking 7 million som (US$80,100) from PolitKlinika and 3 million som (US$34,360) from Asypbek for “undermining the reputation of the channel and its staff” – could force the outlet to close. 

Alimova said she and PolitKlinika have also been the target of online harassment, which she believes to be coordinated involving social media accounts of employees of state media. CPJ reviewed many posts by users calling for legal action to be taken against the outlet.

Also in February, the SCNS summoned Asel Otorbaeva, general director of independent news website 24.kg, for questioning over comments under a 24.kg report, and in March, the SCNS summoned 24.kg editor Anastasia Mokrenko for questioning about a fake bomb threat on a shopping center that was sent to the outlet and others, according to reports by that outlet.

Taliban fighters in Farah Province have detained, beaten, and imprisoned seventy farmers who were protesting the weak management of agricultural product prices in the market.

Sources told Hasht-e Subh that some farmers went to the province’s agriculture department on Wednesday, May 3, and protested. These farmers asked the Taliban’s agriculture department to collaborate with them in controlling the prices of their crops in the markets and to manage the price fluctuations throughout the day, which often drop from 100 to 20 Afghanis.

However, the Taliban not only did not pay attention to their protests and requests but also transferred these farmers by military vehicles to the security observatory in Farah.

Sources say that during the four-hour detention by the Taliban, these farmers were also beaten.

The main agricultural products of this season in Farah Province are eggplants, tomatoes, pumpkins, okra, and watermelons. The lack of storage space and the risk of spoilage are the main concerns of farmers in this province.

Taliban security officials in the province have not yet commented on the detention of protesting farmers.

Earlier, farmers in Farah Province had protested against the unprecedented drop in watermelon prices. In 2022, the price of each kilogram of watermelon in Farah had reached one Afghani.

The main agricultural products of this season in Farah Province are eggplants, tomatoes, pumpkins, okra, and watermelons. The lack of storage space and the risk of spoilage are the main concerns of farmers in this province.

Taliban security officials in the province have not yet commented on the detention of protesting farmers.

Earlier, farmers in Farah Province had protested against the unprecedented drop in watermelon prices. In 2022, the price of each kilogram of watermelon in Farah had reached one Afghani.

15,India,"India: women protest met with violence, arrest",07/05/2023,"For a country that claims to support women empowerment, that has had a rich history of women led movements and resistance, the current heart breaking state of affairs with how India’s champion women wrestlers protest is being handled by authorities and police officers reflects a stark and contradictory reality. Over the past 10 days, the women wrestlers of India have been staging a protest at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi, against the Wrestlers Federation of India chief, Brij Bhusan Singh, alleging him of sexual harassment. Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh is also a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Uttar Pradesh.

Only last week, on April 28, the Delhi Police had told the Supreme Court that they will be filing an FIR based on the sexual harassment charges being levied by seven women wrestlers, including a minor, against the WFI chief. It is important to note here, the protesting wrestlers had to move to the Supreme Court seeking the registration of FIRs against Singh. While the said move by the Delhi police only after the women had approached the Supreme Court, was still seen as a ray of hope, the hardships, there has been no let up for the protesting women champions against the impunity enjoyed by a politically influential man in authority.

On May 3, late-night trouble erupted for women champions who have been camping here day and night, at Jantar Mantar. India’s women champion wrestlers were reportedly abused by Delhi Police officers. Several videos of the wrestlers have gone viral on social media, showing them being surrounded by a couple of cops who misbehaved with them. It is even claimed that male police officer pushed women wrestlers without any women officer being present and that two protestors have even been injured. A drunk cop, according to the wrestlers, misbehaved with them, hurled abuse at female wrestlers, and even manhandled them at the protest site. The wrestlers went live on their respective social media accounts to report the incident.

According to the wrestlers, the Delhi Police had physically stopped them from replacing mattresses that got wet due to rain, resulting in the scuffle. ""The mattresses got wet due to rain, so we were bringing folding beds for sleeping, but the police did not allow that. Drunk policeman Dharmendra abused Vinesh Phogat and got involved in a scuffle with us,"" former wrestler Rajveer told PTI.

In one of the videos, Vinesh Phogat stated that the officers of the Delhi Police hit her brother on the forehead and that he was taken to the hospital for treatment. According to the wrestlers, two of them (Dushyant and Rahul) were injured on their foreheads during the commotion. According to Bajrang Punia, who has been supporting the women wrestlers in their fight since the beginning and has been a part of this protest, this whole commotion occurred as some female wrestlers attempted to bring cots to the protest site due to inclement weather in Delhi, but cops refused to let them. It was alleged by Vinesh that when they brought the planks and foldable beds, a lone drunk male policeman, “Dharmendra”, started pushing the wrestlers around, without any female policeman present.

While addressing media persons late at night, Vinesh said, ""We went to collect some cots from our vehicles as it's all wet out here. Some cops stopped us and started troubling us. There was no female cop nearby and these male cops started pushing us. Who gave them permission to push female protesters?"" Vinesh later asked, ""We are being treated so badly for raising our voices. Is this the price of winning medals for the country? If this is the case then I pray no one wins medals...""If they wish to kill us, then let them shoot us,"" said Vinesh, who can crying inconsolably in the video uploaded by the PTI. ""Did we win medals for the country to see this day? We have not even eaten our food. Does every man have a right to abuse women? These policemen are holding guns, they can kill us,"" an emotionally-drained Vinesh further said.

Sakshi Malik also said, ""We are not going to leave this site till our last breath. The antics of Delhi Police are as if we are criminals. There is no respect for women in their eyes. We are not going to leave till we get justice.""

""Where were female police officers? How can the male officers push us like that? We are not criminals. We do not deserve such treatment. The drunk police officer hit my brother,"" Bajrang Punia said while talking to reporters of PTI. Wrestler Bajrang Punia's wife Sangeeta, who is also a wrestler, said she was pushed around by policemen.

Later, Bajrang Punia urged his countrymen to come to Delhi in large numbers to support their protest. ""This is my humble request to my countrymen. Please arrive in large numbers in Delhi. We are fighting for your daughters' dignity. Please join us here and show your support,"" the Tokyo Olympics medalist said, according to PTI.

Punia also exhorted farmers and members of the public to reach Jantar Mantar in their support. ""I request everyone to reach Delhi by Thursday morning. This is the time. If not, then when? This is a question of the dignity of our daughters. People like Brij Bhushan are roaming freely despite being criminals and all this is happening to us,"" he said.

Delhi Police’s Justifications, denial of having beaten any protestors

Based on the official statement from Delhi's ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), it was their decision to provide the protesting wrestlers with cots in view of the ongoing rainy spell in Delhi as rains continue to lash in the national capital. Senior AAP leader and MLA Somnath Bharti had said, ""On the instructions of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, we have decided to send foldable cots to the protest site. We hope that this small help will make this tough time a little bit easier for the wrestlers.""

Meanwhile, the Delhi police claimed that it was because AAP MLA Somnath Bharti arrived at the protest venue with folding beds without permission that the “scuffle” took place. ""Somnath Bharti brought folding beds to the protest site in Jantar Mantar. Since there was no permission, we didn't allow it, so some of the supporters of the protesting wrestlers tried to take out the beds from the truck and this led to an altercation..."" Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Pranav Tayal provided

""We have told the wrestlers to give complaint on their grievances and will take appropriate action...medical check-up of the Policeman on whom they've raised allegations, being conducted,"" DCP Tayal added further.

The police officers have now claimed that the protestors wrongfully restrained a police man after accusing him of being drunk. The police has also denied that the protestors were beaten.

Footage from the venue also showed the wrestlers arguing with uniformed Delhi Police officers.  ""CCTV cameras must be present. The footage will prove it,"" protesting wrestler Bajrang Punia told reporters after the claims made by the police, of not having beaten anyone. He also stated that Bharti was not present when the commotion occurred, and that the wrestlers had ordered the beds.

Following the scuffle between protesting wrestlers and police officers, the Delhi Police have tightened security around Jantar Mantar. Allegedly, a large police force has also been deployed on the scene, and the entire area has been barricaded.  As provided by NDTV, the police have now sealed the protest site at Jantar Mantar, thereby stopping the regular flow of well-wishers who were coming to meet the protesting wrestler.

It is pertinent to note that the protesting wrestlers have been accusing the Delhi Police of a lack of support, claiming that the Police has been simply dragging its feet on the case because neither Singh nor the women who have complained of sexual harassment have been summoned for questioning.

Proceeding in the Supreme Court

On May 4, the Supreme Court heard the case today to take stock of the investigation and pass any required order regarding the security. It was reported by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was representing the Delhi Police, stated that “proper security” has been provided to minor complainant. They further provided that an individual assessment of all petitioners was conducted by then, and while they found no threats, they have agreed to give the six complainant security with respect to protest. It was further also stated that that three armed police personnel were deployed in Jantar Mantar for the three who are stationed there and round the clock security is there for all the six. And on the watch of all these, the late night assault on May-3 and 4 takes place!

Significantly, senior advocate Hooda, representing the women champion petitioners mentioned clearly before CJI Chandrachud that the wrestlers had been heckled by drunk policemen at night, to which he replied that they can approach the jurisdictional courts and the Delhi High Court with this matter, and that the Supreme Court will not be hearing this issue!

Supporters detained, attempts to gag dissent

According to the Delhi police, three people have been detained following Wednesday's incident: AAP MLA Somnath Bharti, Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda, and Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) Swati Maliwal. According to a video that have gone viral on social media, women Delhi police officers were shockingly seen dragging and lifting the DCW chief from the protest site in a police van. Meanwhile, in the video, Maliwal can be heard shouting, “Don’t touch me. This is completely wrong.” 

After being detained by Delhi police in the late hours of May 3, Swati Maliwal arrived again at Jantar Mantar in the national capital on Thursday morning, May 4. Speaking to Republic, the DCW chief said, ""Am I a terrorist? Why are Delhi Police officials troubling me and the wrestlers? They should arrest Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.""

AAP minister Saurabh Bharadwaj had tagged Delhi L-G V.K. Saxena in a tweet, asking him to take note of the incident. “Please note Lt Governor Delhi. A Delhi Police officer attacked a wrestler at Jantar Mantar. It is alleged that the policeman was drunk. A medical test should be conducted and MLC of the victim should also be registered,” he wrote.

Journalist Sakshi Joshi also posted a video of her being manhandled and detained by the Delhi Police. In the video, she can be heard shouting at the officers that they are tearing her clothes and detaining her without any reason. She also showed her torn clothes in the video. She was then seen sitting in a police bus, and then was taken to the police station.
Journalist Ajit Anjum has also posted a video on YouTube, providing his own narration of the situation that was present at Jantar Mantar. He provided that he had visited the protest site around 12.45 at night, after the Delhi police videos of manhandling the wrestlers had gone viral. When he reached the site, he saw that High level Delhi Police officers were also present at the side, and had barricaded the area, not even allowing journalists to pass. In his video, Ajit Anjun alleged the involvement of the Modi-led BJP government, as the police is under the control of the centre. He had also provided in his video that police could also be heard asking the protestors to vacate from Jantar Mantar. Ajit Anjum also alleged that supporting farmers were also not being allowed to enter the protest side.

While full throttled and government sanctioned attempts are being made to gag the protestors, independent media and any dissenters who are exercising their rights, Singh has been roaming free, declaring that all the complainants against have been manipulated or “paid”. The protesting wrestlers, according to him, were those who were at “Shaheen Bagh and the farmers’ protest”.

Response by the Wrestlers

According to News18, the protesting wrestlers have written to Union Home Ministry seeking strict action against officials responsible for the alleged manhandling of grapplers at the protest site on Wednesday night. In the letter, they have also sought permission to bring waterproof tents, beds, gym instruments, wrestling mats and sound system at the protest.

It has also been reported that the Aam Aadmi Party has called for a meeting of all MLAs, councillors and office bearers of AAP. The party will conduct a meeting on what transpired at Jantar Mantar on Wednesday night.",Freedom of assembly

Response by the Wrestlers

According to News18, the protesting wrestlers have written to Union Home Ministry seeking strict action against officials responsible for the alleged manhandling of grapplers at the protest site on Wednesday night.

15,India,"India: women protest met with violence, arrest",07/05/2023,"For a country that claims to support women empowerment, that has had a rich history of women led movements and resistance, the current heart breaking state of affairs with how India’s champion women wrestlers protest is being handled by authorities and police officers reflects a stark and contradictory reality. Over the past 10 days, the women wrestlers of India have been staging a protest at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi, against the Wrestlers Federation of India chief, Brij Bhusan Singh, alleging him of sexual harassment. Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh is also a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Uttar Pradesh.

Only last week, on April 28, the Delhi Police had told the Supreme Court that they will be filing an FIR based on the sexual harassment charges being levied by seven women wrestlers, including a minor, against the WFI chief. It is important to note here, the protesting wrestlers had to move to the Supreme Court seeking the registration of FIRs against Singh. While the said move by the Delhi police only after the women had approached the Supreme Court, was still seen as a ray of hope, the hardships, there has been no let up for the protesting women champions against the impunity enjoyed by a politically influential man in authority.

On May 3, late-night trouble erupted for women champions who have been camping here day and night, at Jantar Mantar. India’s women champion wrestlers were reportedly abused by Delhi Police officers. Several videos of the wrestlers have gone viral on social media, showing them being surrounded by a couple of cops who misbehaved with them. It is even claimed that male police officer pushed women wrestlers without any women officer being present and that two protestors have even been injured. A drunk cop, according to the wrestlers, misbehaved with them, hurled abuse at female wrestlers, and even manhandled them at the protest site. The wrestlers went live on their respective social media accounts to report the incident.

According to the wrestlers, the Delhi Police had physically stopped them from replacing mattresses that got wet due to rain, resulting in the scuffle. ""The mattresses got wet due to rain, so we were bringing folding beds for sleeping, but the police did not allow that. Drunk policeman Dharmendra abused Vinesh Phogat and got involved in a scuffle with us,"" former wrestler Rajveer told PTI.

In one of the videos, Vinesh Phogat stated that the officers of the Delhi Police hit her brother on the forehead and that he was taken to the hospital for treatment. According to the wrestlers, two of them (Dushyant and Rahul) were injured on their foreheads during the commotion. According to Bajrang Punia, who has been supporting the women wrestlers in their fight since the beginning and has been a part of this protest, this whole commotion occurred as some female wrestlers attempted to bring cots to the protest site due to inclement weather in Delhi, but cops refused to let them. It was alleged by Vinesh that when they brought the planks and foldable beds, a lone drunk male policeman, “Dharmendra”, started pushing the wrestlers around, without any female policeman present.

While addressing media persons late at night, Vinesh said, ""We went to collect some cots from our vehicles as it's all wet out here. Some cops stopped us and started troubling us. There was no female cop nearby and these male cops started pushing us. Who gave them permission to push female protesters?"" Vinesh later asked, ""We are being treated so badly for raising our voices. Is this the price of winning medals for the country? If this is the case then I pray no one wins medals...""If they wish to kill us, then let them shoot us,"" said Vinesh, who can crying inconsolably in the video uploaded by the PTI. ""Did we win medals for the country to see this day? We have not even eaten our food. Does every man have a right to abuse women? These policemen are holding guns, they can kill us,"" an emotionally-drained Vinesh further said.

Sakshi Malik also said, ""We are not going to leave this site till our last breath. The antics of Delhi Police are as if we are criminals. There is no respect for women in their eyes. We are not going to leave till we get justice.""

""Where were female police officers? How can the male officers push us like that? We are not criminals. We do not deserve such treatment. The drunk police officer hit my brother,"" Bajrang Punia said while talking to reporters of PTI. Wrestler Bajrang Punia's wife Sangeeta, who is also a wrestler, said she was pushed around by policemen.

Later, Bajrang Punia urged his countrymen to come to Delhi in large numbers to support their protest. ""This is my humble request to my countrymen. Please arrive in large numbers in Delhi. We are fighting for your daughters' dignity. Please join us here and show your support,"" the Tokyo Olympics medalist said, according to PTI.

Punia also exhorted farmers and members of the public to reach Jantar Mantar in their support. ""I request everyone to reach Delhi by Thursday morning. This is the time. If not, then when? This is a question of the dignity of our daughters. People like Brij Bhushan are roaming freely despite being criminals and all this is happening to us,"" he said.

Delhi Police’s Justifications, denial of having beaten any protestors

Based on the official statement from Delhi's ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), it was their decision to provide the protesting wrestlers with cots in view of the ongoing rainy spell in Delhi as rains continue to lash in the national capital. Senior AAP leader and MLA Somnath Bharti had said, ""On the instructions of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, we have decided to send foldable cots to the protest site. We hope that this small help will make this tough time a little bit easier for the wrestlers.""

Meanwhile, the Delhi police claimed that it was because AAP MLA Somnath Bharti arrived at the protest venue with folding beds without permission that the “scuffle” took place. ""Somnath Bharti brought folding beds to the protest site in Jantar Mantar. Since there was no permission, we didn't allow it, so some of the supporters of the protesting wrestlers tried to take out the beds from the truck and this led to an altercation..."" Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Pranav Tayal provided

""We have told the wrestlers to give complaint on their grievances and will take appropriate action...medical check-up of the Policeman on whom they've raised allegations, being conducted,"" DCP Tayal added further.

The police officers have now claimed that the protestors wrongfully restrained a police man after accusing him of being drunk. The police has also denied that the protestors were beaten.

Footage from the venue also showed the wrestlers arguing with uniformed Delhi Police officers.  ""CCTV cameras must be present. The footage will prove it,"" protesting wrestler Bajrang Punia told reporters after the claims made by the police, of not having beaten anyone. He also stated that Bharti was not present when the commotion occurred, and that the wrestlers had ordered the beds.

Following the scuffle between protesting wrestlers and police officers, the Delhi Police have tightened security around Jantar Mantar. Allegedly, a large police force has also been deployed on the scene, and the entire area has been barricaded.  As provided by NDTV, the police have now sealed the protest site at Jantar Mantar, thereby stopping the regular flow of well-wishers who were coming to meet the protesting wrestler.

It is pertinent to note that the protesting wrestlers have been accusing the Delhi Police of a lack of support, claiming that the Police has been simply dragging its feet on the case because neither Singh nor the women who have complained of sexual harassment have been summoned for questioning.

Proceeding in the Supreme Court

On May 4, the Supreme Court heard the case today to take stock of the investigation and pass any required order regarding the security. It was reported by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was representing the Delhi Police, stated that “proper security” has been provided to minor complainant. They further provided that an individual assessment of all petitioners was conducted by then, and while they found no threats, they have agreed to give the six complainant security with respect to protest. It was further also stated that that three armed police personnel were deployed in Jantar Mantar for the three who are stationed there and round the clock security is there for all the six. And on the watch of all these, the late night assault on May-3 and 4 takes place!

Significantly, senior advocate Hooda, representing the women champion petitioners mentioned clearly before CJI Chandrachud that the wrestlers had been heckled by drunk policemen at night, to which he replied that they can approach the jurisdictional courts and the Delhi High Court with this matter, and that the Supreme Court will not be hearing this issue!

Supporters detained, attempts to gag dissent

According to the Delhi police, three people have been detained following Wednesday's incident: AAP MLA Somnath Bharti, Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda, and Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) Swati Maliwal. According to a video that have gone viral on social media, women Delhi police officers were shockingly seen dragging and lifting the DCW chief from the protest site in a police van. Meanwhile, in the video, Maliwal can be heard shouting, “Don’t touch me. This is completely wrong.” 

After being detained by Delhi police in the late hours of May 3, Swati Maliwal arrived again at Jantar Mantar in the national capital on Thursday morning, May 4. Speaking to Republic, the DCW chief said, ""Am I a terrorist? Why are Delhi Police officials troubling me and the wrestlers? They should arrest Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.""

Around 15 others, who had reached the protesting site, have also been detained in a bus. AAP minister Saurabh Bhardwaj was also among those. Slogans of ‘jai jawan jai kisan’ and ‘Bharat Mata ki jai’ were also being raised by the protestors.

AAP minister Saurabh Bharadwaj had tagged Delhi L-G V.K. Saxena in a tweet, asking him to take note of the incident. “Please note Lt Governor Delhi. A Delhi Police officer attacked a wrestler at Jantar Mantar. It is alleged that the policeman was drunk. A medical test should be conducted and MLC of the victim should also be registered,” he wrote.

According to a video that have gone viral on social media, women Delhi police officers were shockingly seen dragging and lifting the DCW chief from the protest site in a police van. Meanwhile, in the video, Maliwal can be heard shouting, “Don’t touch me. This is completely wrong.” 

After being detained by Delhi police in the late hours of May 3, Swati Maliwal arrived again at Jantar Mantar in the national capital on Thursday morning, May 4. Speaking to Republic, the DCW chief said, ""Am I a terrorist? Why are Delhi Police officials troubling me and the wrestlers? They should arrest Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.""

Around 15 others, who had reached the protesting site, have also been detained in a bus. AAP minister Saurabh Bhardwaj was also among those. Slogans of ‘jai jawan jai kisan’ and ‘Bharat Mata ki jai’ were also being raised by the protestors.

AAP minister Saurabh Bharadwaj had tagged Delhi L-G V.K. Saxena in a tweet, asking him to take note of the incident. “Please note Lt Governor Delhi. A Delhi Police officer attacked a wrestler at Jantar Mantar. It is alleged that the policeman was drunk. A medical test should be conducted and MLC of the victim should also be registered,” he wrote.

Journalist Sakshi Joshi also posted a video of her being manhandled and detained by the Delhi Police. In the video, she can be heard shouting at the officers that they are tearing her clothes and detaining her without any reason. She also showed her torn clothes in the video. She was then seen sitting in a police bus, and then was taken to the police station.
Journalist Ajit Anjum has also posted a video on YouTube, providing his own narration of the situation that was present at Jantar Mantar. He provided that he had visited the protest site around 12.45 at night, after the Delhi police videos of manhandling the wrestlers had gone viral. When he reached the site, he saw that High level Delhi Police officers were also present at the side, and had barricaded the area, not even allowing journalists to pass. In his video, Ajit Anjun alleged the involvement of the Modi-led BJP government, as the police is under the control of the centre. He had also provided in his video that police could also be heard asking the protestors to vacate from Jantar Mantar. Ajit Anjum also alleged that supporting farmers were also not being allowed to enter the protest side.

While full throttled and government sanctioned attempts are being made to gag the protestors, independent media and any dissenters who are exercising their rights, Singh has been roaming free, declaring that all the complainants against have been manipulated or “paid”. The protesting wrestlers, according to him, were those who were at “Shaheen Bagh and the farmers’ protest”.

Response by the Wrestlers

According to News18, the protesting wrestlers have written to Union Home Ministry seeking strict action against officials responsible for the alleged manhandling of grapplers at the protest site on Wednesday night. In the letter, they have also sought permission to bring waterproof tents, beds, gym instruments, wrestling mats and sound system at the protest.

It has also been reported that the Aam Aadmi Party has called for a meeting of all MLAs, councillors and office bearers of AAP. The party will conduct a meeting on what transpired at Jantar Mantar on Wednesday night.",Right to healthy and safe environment

17,Mongolia,Mongolia: minority rights defender arrested and deported by Chinese police,14/05/2023,"

On May 3, 2023, four policemen with two police vehicles from China came to the independent country of Mongolia and arrested Mr. Lhamjab Borjigin, a prominent Southern Mongolian writer in exile, at his temporary residence in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar. Shortly after the arrest, Borjigin was deported back to China on the same day.

A week before the arrest, Borjigin notified the Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center (SMHRIC) that the Chinese authorities were harassing and threatening his family members in Southern Mongolia.

“My family members told me that an army of police and security personnel are visiting my family and pressuring them to bring me back,” Borjigin said in the audio message to the SMHRIC. “They are claiming to come to Mongolia with my daughter and bring me back.”

The SMHRIC immediately contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ (UNHCR’s) regional office in Bangkok, Thailand, and demanded urgent action to prevent Borjigin from being deported to China. An unidentified official from the office responded to the SMHRIC by email, asking for Borjigin’s phone number and email address. After providing Borjigin’s contact details, the SMHRIC did not receive further communication from the office. The question of whether the office was able to contact him remained unanswered. 

“Yes, unfortunately, he was brought back to China on May 3. Some of his family members were also among the dispatchers from China,” a close friend of Borjigin from Ulaanbaatar told the SMHRIC. “Nothing we can do about it now. All we can do is publish his books here.”

As a well-known Southern Mongolian dissident writer and the author of numerous books, Borjigin was sentenced to two years in prison in 2019 for writing a book entitled China’s Cultural Revolution. In 2021, following his prison term, he was placed under indefinite “residential surveillance,” a form of house arrest.

On March 6, 2023, Borjigin managed to escape from China and arrived in the independent country of Mongolia. According to his testimony to the SMHRIC, his plan was to publish his three books in Mongolia to inform the world of how the Chinese colonial regime had established itself in Southern Mongolia and how the Mongolian resistance had been quashed. 

“These are my plans should I be lucky enough to live a few more years in peace here without being followed, monitored and questioned, until being called by Karl Marx to join him in heaven,” Borjigin said in the testimony. 

This is the fifth major case of the deportation of Southern Mongolian dissidents in exile from the independent country of Mongolia since 2009. In most cases, the Chinese authorities sent their police directly to Mongolia to make their arrests on Mongolian soil. They completed the deportation process in coordination with the Government of Mongolia. 

In 2009, Chinese police dispatchers arrested Mr. Batzangaa, a Southern Mongolian dissident and Mongol-Tibetan medical school principal, in front of the UNHCR office building in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Along with his daughter and wife, he was deported to China and sentenced to three years in prison followed by indefinite surveillance. 

In a similar case, Chinese police dispatchers recently detained and interrogated a Southern Mongolian dissident named Adiyaa in Bangkok, Thailand. Thanks to the urgent intervention of the UNHCR’s regional office, Mr. Adiyaa was swiftly resettled in Canada shortly after. 

As China doubles down on efforts to pressure her neighboring countries to silence criticism, Mr. Munkhbayar Chuluundorj, a Mongolian citizen, human rights defender, writer and journalist, was sentenced to 10 years in prison last year. The charge brought against him was “collaborating with a foreign intelligence agency to spy against the People’s Republic of China.” Chuluundorj has been an outspoken critic of China’s human rights violations in Southern Mongolia and the Mongolian authorities’ unusually cozy relationship with the Chinese Communist regime.

18,India,India: five HRDs house raided,05/05/2023,"CASR vehemently condemns the raid on anti-displacement activist Damodar Turi, Jailed Journalist Rupesh Kumar Singh and Majdoor Sangthan Samiti (MSS) activists Bacha Singh, Nageshwar Mahto, and Sanjay Turi.

On 2th May 2023, NIA raided the houses of several activists in various places of Jharkhand. The series of raid started early morning around 5 am , with the first house being of Damodar Turi.There were almost 150 local police with NIA to carry out this raid. Journalist Rupesh Kumar’s house was also raided, despite him being currently in jail under UAPA case. During the raid, several belonging of activists were broken, books and phones were taken away.

This is not the first time that Mazdoor Sangathan Samiti (MSS) has been targeted. In 2018, MSS was illegally banned on the pretext of being a Maoist frontal organization. Following the ban, Damodar Turi, an anti displacement activist, was also arbitrarily arrested and slapped with UAPA for being a member of MSS. Where as Damodar Turi was never a member of MSS and had only once went to deliver a speech in MSS’s program. After 4 long years of legal battle, Ranchi High Court declared the ban on MSS as illegal and uplifted the ban.
While Damodar Turi has been actively vocal against the corporate loot of people’s resources and their displacement, MSS has been active for over three decades in organizing contract workers in the coal mines of Dhanbad, Giridih and Bokaro. The organization has constructed a hospital at Madhuban, Giridhi for free medical assistance of poor and the workers. The resistance and pro people construction of an organized working class organization, which is presenting a people’s model of development, starkly in contrast to the corporate-state’s model of development based on resource loot and displacement, is a threat to the state’s narrative of portraying itself as pro development and the resisting forces as anti development. To crush this alternate idea of people’s power and people’s devolopment, the governments in power have used bans to outlaw opposition and dissent. This recent clampdown is also part of a larger attempt to crush those who dare to resist the Jharkhand government’s anti-people policies.

Journalist Rupesh Kumar Singh was also arrested in a frivolous case for this purpose only, as he has exposed the destructive impact of imperialist development on the people of Jharkhand, spoke against the foreign loot of country’s resources and displacement of adivasi people. He has also extensively worked on bringing to light, the conditions of working class in these regions of Jharkhand, dominated by mining giants. It is in the interest of these mining giants and corporate loot, that anti displacement activist, journalists and working class organization is being attacked. These activists have been targetted constantly because they challenge the regime’s anti people approach, be it the illegal displacement of tribals for corporate loot of resources or curbing the rights of workers. When Prime Minister gives a statement stating “ Pen wale aur bandook wale”- books also become a weapon and so does the brain. India has become a prison for any dissenting voice. And hence raids like this have become a norm in this fascist state. NIA is now an agent to curb any dissenting voice. These on going series of raids on activists is unquestionably a violation of the fundamental rights of activist.

A pattern of raiding and arresting is visible, either in the case of journalist Rupesh Kumar Singh or of other activists. We see the rise of reactionary and undemocratic methods of silencing peoples voices under this Brahmanical Hindutva fascist regime. There is an urgent need to forge a broader solidarity of all the democratic and progressive forces, the oppressed and exploited masses to stop these kind of blatant fascist attack and resist Brahmanical Hindutva Fascism.

19,Thailand,Thailand: public servant for Government,07/05/2023,"On 2 May 2023, Supat Hasuwannakit, Chair of the Rural Doctor Society and Director of Saba Yoi Hospital, posted on Facebook that he went to Nonthaburi Police Station to acknowledge three charges, including defamation, insulting officials, and computer-related crime, filed by Rungrueng Kitphati, spokesperson of the Ministry of Public Health.

Supat has been well known for his ongoing criticism of the government, particularly COVID-19 mismanagement under Anutin Charnvirakul, the Minister of Public Health. 

In 2020, he criticized the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and antigen test kits (ATKs). He has also questioned the unfair transfers of medical personnel and opposed the free cannabis policy.

In December 2022, the Ministry of Public Health approved the transfer of Supat from Chana Hospital to Saba Yoi Hospital. Supat noted at the time that his transfer was not normal and unfair. He believed that his transfer was related to his criticisms of the Ministry. He insisted that governance is a core value of public administration. Transferring him was a reflection of the destruction of this core value.

14 February 2023, Rungrueng filed a complaint against Supat and the Rural Doctor Society Facebook page, explaining that the Facebook page did not provide necessary information to the public but misinformation, greatly affecting public health services. The Ministry believed that the page had a hidden political agenda. 

Supat said that earlier, he and a team of rural doctors were examined and transferred to remote locations. Supat himself was transferred to Saba Yoi District. However, he insisted that criticism of irregularities in the Ministry of Public Health is still ongoing. He added that this is a proxy war between rural doctors and top officials. He also encouraged everyone to cast a ballot on 14 May 2023 in order to restore good governance to the Ministry of Public Health.",Right to work
20,Kazakhstan,Kazakhstan: anti-government demonstrators arrested,01/05/2023,"

Police in Almaty on May 1 detained about a dozen people at an opposition rally called by fugitive Kazakh oligarch and opposition politician leader Mukhtar Ablyazov.

About 20 people gathered near the Central Park of Culture and Recreation for the afternoon rally before police began making arrests without explanation.

Some demonstrators held signs reading: “There is no road for China on Kazakh land,” while others demanded a fair investigation into unprecedented anti-government protests in the Central Asian nation in January 2022 that began over a sudden fuel price hike and grew into broader unrest against corruption, political stagnation, and widespread injustice. Violent clashes during the demonstrations left at least 238 people dead, including 19 law enforcement officers.

Ablyazov, an outspoken critic of the Kazakh government who received political asylum in France several years ago, is wanted in Kazakhstan and Russia on suspicion of embezzling some $5 billion. Ablyazov rejects the charge as politically motivated.

The fugitive tycoon established the opposition movement Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan (DVK) and regularly uses the Internet to organize unsanctioned anti-government rallies across Kazakhstan. DVK was labelled as extremist and banned in Kazakhstan in March 2018.

Demonstrations were held on May 1 in other cities in Kazakhstan after civil activists announced peaceful rallies in support of Ukraine and Kazakhstan's withdrawal from the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) in which Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan are also members.

Applications filed by some activists for peaceful assemblies on May 1 were refused by authorities citing other events and incomplete information on applications for rallies.

One human rights group reported police surveillance of civil activists in different Kazakh cities, and some activists reportedly were detained or summoned to the police department.

21,China,China: citizen journalist faces administrative harassment after release from prison,07/05/2023,"Beijing authorities have refused to accept Wuhan-based citizen journalist Fang Bin for relocation after he was bundled onto a high-speed train for the capital shortly after his release from a three-year jail term on Sunday.

Fang was sentenced to three years' imprisonment at a secret trial on orders from Beijing after filming from hospitals and funeral homes early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Radio Free Asia reported last week.

After his release, he was turned around and sent right back again by Beijing police as the authorities stepped up ""stability maintenance"" measures aimed at getting rid of other politically sensitive figures who have made their homes in the capital.

The Wuhan authorities had believed they were relocating Fang to live with his son, but his son was himself under huge political pressure from the authorities not to have Fang Bin live with him, according to a person familiar with the matter.

""His son was apparently under pressure, and that made his father unwilling to stay in Beijing, so the son took Fang Bin out to eat, bought him some clothes, then Beijing police bought Fang Bin a high-speed train ticket and sent him back to Wuhan on the train that same evening,"" said the person, who asked to remain anonymous.

Fang was scheduled to arrive in Wuchang, one of the cities in the Wuhan conurbation, at around 9.00 a.m. on Monday, where he was reportedly met by relatives, according to another person who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals.

However, repeated attempts to contact him were unsuccessful on Monday.

""The police told Fang Bin that he's not allowed to give any interviews or post videos online,"" the person said. 

""He went to the traditional Chinese clothing store that he used to run in Hankou North this afternoon, but found that everything in it had been taken away,"" the person said. ""I heard that Fang Bin lost a tooth in prison, but I don't know exactly how.""

His release comes amid reports that Fang's sister is unwilling to have him living with her, according to someone familiar with the matter who gave only the surname Liu.

""Fang Bin's sister is likely under pressure [from the authorities], and doesn't want Fang Bin living with her,"" Liu said. ""He will stay with his sister [Monday] night, then will find somewhere else to live in Wuhan later.""

""But the Wuhan police don't want Fang Bin to stay in Wuhan either,"" Liu added.",Right to healthy and safe environment

""His son was apparently under pressure, and that made his father unwilling to stay in Beijing, so the son took Fang Bin out to eat, bought him some clothes, then Beijing police bought Fang Bin a high-speed train ticket and sent him back to Wuhan on the train that same evening,"" said the person, who asked to remain anonymous.

Fang was scheduled to arrive in Wuchang, one of the cities in the Wuhan conurbation, at around 9.00 a.m. on Monday, where he was reportedly met by relatives, according to another person who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals.

However, repeated attempts to contact him were unsuccessful on Monday.

""The police told Fang Bin that he's not allowed to give any interviews or post videos online,"" the person said. 

""He went to the traditional Chinese clothing store that he used to run in Hankou North this afternoon, but found that everything in it had been taken away,"" the person said. ""I heard that Fang Bin lost a tooth in prison, but I don't know exactly how.""

His release comes amid reports that Fang's sister is unwilling to have him living with her, according to someone familiar with the matter who gave only the surname Liu.

""Fang Bin's sister is likely under pressure [from the authorities], and doesn't want Fang Bin living with her,"" Liu said. ""He will stay with his sister [Monday] night, then will find somewhere else to live in Wuhan later.""

""But the Wuhan police don't want Fang Bin to stay in Wuhan either,"" Liu added.",Freedom of movement
22,Lao People's Democratic Republic,Lao PDR: young social media activist gunned down,03/05/2023,"A Laos political activist who was reported to have died after being shot point blank in the face and chest is alive, activists say.

The family of Anousa Luangsuphom, 25, has told Human Rights Watch (HRW) he is recovering in hospital after being shot in a cafe in the capital Vientiane.

They had initially told people he had died in a bid to protect him from being targeted again, the rights group said.

This reflects the level of fear for dissidents in Laos, the group added.

""Friends and family basically told people he was dead because they were worried if the gunman knew that they had not succeeded in killing him, they would return to finish the job,"" said HRW spokesman Phil Robertson.

Mr Luangsuphom is a prominent critic of the Laos government. Security camera footage of his attack on Saturday night has been widely shared on social media and reported in local media.

It shows a gunman dressed in a brown long-sleeved shirt and black cap using a facemask to open the cafe door, before entering and firing twice at Mr Luangsuphom, who is seated on the floor.

The video then shows the gunman fleeing while bystanders rush to Mr Luangsuphom's aid.

The activist is known for running the Kub Kluen Duay Keyboard (Driven By Keyboard) Facebook page, where people have expressed criticism of the Communist authorities.

On Wednesday night, the page's administrators shared a message from another Laos political commentator, based in Europe, who has a large online following among people in Laos and abroad.

The family had requested that the Facebook influencer release the information that Mr Luangsuphom was alive, Mr Robertson said.

They had chosen to do this after the incorrect news of Mr Luangsuphom's death was reported by global outlets, including the BBC, prompting Laos police to track him down in a Vientiane hospital.

Photos published by the Facebook page appear to show him unconscious in a hospital bed with wounds and bruising on his face. The BBC has sought comment from the page's administrator.

There has been criticism of Laos authorities' slow response to the shooting. Before Wednesday, authorities had not announced an investigation into it.

Police are still yet to show they are properly investigating the attack, Mr Robertson said.

He said the family's ""protective"" actions showed ""there is clearly no confidence in the Laos government whatsoever that it is there to protect the citizens of the country"".

It follows similar criticism over cases of other activists who have vanished or been targeted,

HRW had earlier noted the ""enforced disappearance"" of activist Sombath Somphone, whose whereabouts remain unknown more than 10 years after he was taken into police custody in Vientiane.

It also cited the case of Od Sayavong, a Lao activist living in Bangkok, who has been missing since August 2019.

Government officials had denied any knowledge of both disappearances.

There is little room for political opposition or dissenting voices in Communist-ruled Laos, one of Asia's poorest countries.

The landlocked country between Thailand and China is a one-party state, ruled by the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, where ""authorities use legal restrictions and intimidation tactics against state critics"", says the US political advocacy group Freedom House. 

Jack Anousa, an administrator of a Facebook group that uncovered and denounced human rights abuses in Laos and called for the end of one-party rule, was shot at 10:26 pm on Saturday in the After School Chocolate & Bar shop in Vientiane’s Chanthabury district.

On his Facebook page, which has over 10,000 followers, Anousa recently posted comments saying that while the government has blamed thick haze on farmers burning forests and farmland, city dwellers have also burned lots of trash and Chinese and Vietnamese companies have burned toxic waste that has polluted the air.

Last May, he published a post about how the Lao and Chinese governments helped each other get rich while Lao people have only grown poorer.",Right to healthy and safe environment
23,Myanmar,Myanmar: student leader sentenced to additional 10 years,03/05/2023,"A court at Yangon’s Insein Prison has sentenced student activist Banyar Soe Htet to an additional 10 years in prison, meaning he is set to serve a total of 84 years, an official at his pro-democracy organization said Monday.

Friday’s terrorism charge was made under Article 50 (j) of the Counter-Terrorism Act, which relates to funding terrorism.

It comes on top of two murder charges related to the killing of Thein Aung, general manager at junta-owned telecommunications company Mytel, along with the shooting of a grocery store owner and his wife in Yangon’s Hlaing township, said an official from the Yangon Revolution Force, who declined to be named for security reasons.

Friday's trial was held in secret in the prison court so his plea and any defense statement are not known.

The 26-year-old was arrested last November and has been held in Insein Prison ever since, his family barred from visiting, according to a friend who didn't want to be named for fear of reprisals.

The friend told RFA Banyar Soe Htet has legal representation but the lawyer was not allowed to meet his client ahead of the trial and has been banned from talking to the media.

His family has not decided whether to appeal the court's decision, the friend said.

Banyar Soe Htet was a physics major at Yangon Eastern University when the military seized power in a Feb. 1, 2021 coup and soon became active in the anti-regime Yangon Revolution Force.

The YRF, mainly composed of students and other young activists, targets junta-related groups and buildings in the country's business capital.

The official who informed RFA about the latest sentence said young educated people are being sentenced to prison terms that are even longer than their lives because the junta is manipulating the law to silence dissent.

“The law is in their hands, so they are making arbitrary orders according to their wishes,” the official said.

“Our imprisoned comrades say they are continuing to fight. Our anti-dictatorship actions will not stop because of this unjust sentence.”

More than 21,600 anti-junta activists have been arrested nationwide since the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.

Some 17,726 of them are still being held in prisons across the country.",Right to liberty and security

24,Pakistan,"Pakistan: media worker, his son abducted and tortured for taking part in a protest",15/05/2023,"In a rising trend of violent attacks against Pakistani media workers, Bannu-based journalist Gohar Wazir was abducted and allegedly electrocuted, while two senior journalists, Irfan Kalhoro and Paryal Dayo, were kidnapped, tortured and sexually assaulted in the Sindh province. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) and its affiliate, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), condemn the kidnapping of the three journalists and urge the Pakistani government to apprehend the perpetrators and protect the country’s working journalists.

On April 20, Gohar Wazir, president of Bannu’s National Press Club and a journalist for a privately owned Pashto television channel, was abducted and held in an unknown location for over 30 hours by unidentified assailants. Wazir reported suffering electric shocks during his illegal confinement, with the journalist suspecting that pro-government militants in the area were involved in his kidnapping.

Wazir claimed that his abductors forced him to record a video pledging to cease his criticism of the government and pro-government militants. When he initially refused to comply, he was subject to repeated electric shocks. The journalist attained medical treatment at a local hospital following his release, with police yet to register a First Information Report (FIR) against Wazir’s assailants.

In a separate incident, journalists Irfan Kalhoro, a local news reporter for Dharti, and Paryal Dayo, president of Pano Aqil Press Club, were abducted, tortured, and arrested in the Pano Aqil district of Pakistan’s Sindh province.

On the evening of April 28, Abdullah Chachar, a government employee, along with approximately 15 to 20 armed men, forcefully entered and ransacked Kalhoro’s house, torturing and detaining him. On his release, instead of acting against the perpetrators, police officers at Pano Aqil police station lodged an FIR against Kalhoro and arrested him.

Several journalists, including Paryal Dayo, protested the reporter’s arrest, after which Abdullah Chachar and armed accomplices reportedly abducted Paryal Dayo and his son torturing, robbing and sexually assaulting them.

Local police have since filed two FIRs in connection with the incident, but no arrest has been made. Rasheed a Rizvi, chairman of the Commission for the Protection of Journalists and Other Media Practitioners (CJMP), noted the abduction and torture of the two journalists and called for an expedited probe from the Sindh Home Secretary.

Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) President GM Jamali and Secretary General Rana Muhammad Azeem strongly condemned the abduction and torture of journalists across Pakistan and demanded law enforcement agencies arrest the culprits, reiterating the importance of providing security to working journalists.

According to the IFJ’s South Asia Press Freedom Report 2022-2023, 101 media rights violations were recorded over the last year in Pakistan, with 5 journalists killed.

25,Philippines,Philippines: two defenders abducted,15/05/2023,"Two indigenous peoples’ rights activists in the Cordillera were reported missing, prompting student and youth organizations to stage a rally to protest what they believed to be the handiwork of state forces.

The missing activists are Gene Roz Jamil “Bazoo” de Jesus, 27, and Dexter Capuyan, 56, both graduates of the University of the Philippines-Baguio (UPB). Their relatives and colleagues said they lost contact with them on April 28, according to a statement released by the Cordillera Human Rights Alliance (CHRA) on Thursday, May 4.

Several student organizations, including the Alliance of Concerned Students (ACS), Tabak, and Anakbayan, organized a public rally on Friday, May 5, demanding the safe return of the two missing activists, who were suspected of being in state custody.

De Jesus works as an information and networking officer for the Philippine Task Force for Indigenous Peoples’ Rights, while Capuyan is an activist-leader based in Benguet province’s capital town of La Trinidad.

De Jesus served as chair of the Alliance of Concerned Students and the Council of Leaders at UP-Baguio, while Capuyan is a former editor-in-chief of UP-Baguio’s campus publication Outcrop, and chair of the League of Filipino Students (LFS) in the 1980s.

The CHRA raised fears of state custody, as the military and police previously accused Capuyan of being a ranking officer of the Chadli Molintas Command of the New People’s Army (NPA) operating in the Ilocos and Cordillera regions with a P1.85-million bounty on his head.

CHRA spokesperson Casselle Ton said the pair’s last known location was in Rizal, where Capuyan sought medical treatment.

“We still continue the search. We still continue (to ask) the public and government officials and the Commission on Human Rights to help us surface these two,” Ton said.

De Jesus’s mother, an overseas Filipino worker in Italy, posted in Filipino on her Facebook page appealing for the return of her son.

“This is very difficult for our family … We’re trying to act normal when facing this, but behind it all is our anguish. We’re hoping that the search will turn out well,” she said.

Officials of Barangay Dolores in Taytay, Rizal, confirmed that De Jesus’s sister went to the police to file a missing person report.

Roy Tapawan, the barangay chairman, said he was the one who advised De Jesus’s family to report the matter to the police “because he has been missing for three days already. He said the missing person report should have been filed much earlier.

Capuyan’s relatives also went to the barangay on May 4 to report his disappearance.",Right to healthy and safe environment

“The closure of Radio Azattyk is not only an act of censorship targeting one media outlet; it is a major blow to freedom of expression in the country. The Kyrgyzstani authorities have taken a further step towards silencing critical coverage of events in the country and muzzling journalists.”

“The allegation made by the Kyrgyzstani authorities, that a video published by Radio Azattyk propagated hatred, is not only false but a manifest pretense. The authorities have been seeking any excuse to shut down an independent media voice.

“The court decision will be challenged on appeal, and Amnesty International reiterates its call for the country’s authorities to withdraw their order to shut down Radio Azattyk altogether, stop the harassment and intimidation of journalists and government critics, and fully respect, protect and facilitate the exercise of the right to freedom of expression for all media in Kyrgyzstan.”

Background

On 27 April, the Lenin District Court of Bishkek, the Kyrgyzstani capital, granted the request of the Ministry of Culture, Information, Sport and Youth to terminate Radio Azattyk’s operations. The reason for the lawsuit was reportedly the publication on Radio Azattyk’s social media channels of a video produced by the radio’s sister organization, Current Time TV, which covered the September 2022 border conflict between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The Kyrgyzstani authorities claimed that the video violated the law “On the Mass Media,” which forbids “propaganda of war, violence and cruelty, national, religious exclusivity and intolerance to other peoples and nations,” and demanded that it be removed.

In October 2022, access to Radio Azattyk’s website was “temporarily” blocked while its bank accounts were frozen, allegedly under national money laundering legislation. In December, the website ban was declared “indefinite” by the authorities.

Over the past year, government critics, journalists and other media workers have been repeatedly harassed in Kyrgyzstan.

One landlord shut off the gas and electricity for Beijing lawyer Wang Quanzhang’s home. Meanwhile, lawyer Li Heping was forcibly evicted.
709 Crackdown

On July 9, 2015, the Ministry of Public Security of China launched a large-scale arrest and crackdown on lawyers and human rights defenders. Over 300 rights activists were arrested overnight, known as the “709 Case.” More than 7 years have passed, and the suppression against human rights lawyers has not been eliminated.
Wang Quanzhang

Lawyer Wang Quanzhang was sentenced to 4 years and 6 months in prison in 2019. On the morning of April 26, he and his wife, Li Wenzu, were forced to move out of their rented home in Beijing after their landlord cut off their electricity.
Forced to leave

Wang disclosed the situation on Twitter. According to him, the landlord, last name Li, led an electrician from the power supply company to cut off the power to their rented house and forced them to move. On the 27th, while Li Wenzu was cooking, she realized the landlord also shut off their gas.
Renewing the lease

Three months ago, the regular lease expired and turned into a cancelable lease. After Li Wenzu announced her candidacy for the National People’s Congress, the landlord suddenly changed her mind and said she would not rent to them anymore. Some back-and-forth communication ensued, and she was willing to renew the lease again.
Change of mind

In April, the authorities stepped up on the surveillance of Wang Quanzhang, and the landlord changed her mind again. On April 20, they were suddenly given notice to move out in a week. Otherwise, the water, electricity, and gas would be cut off. On the 25th, the landlord first asked the residential property management to help cut off the power, but they refused. The landlord then asked workers from the power supply company to help.
Illegal eviction

Wang Quanzhang  tweeted that the eviction violated the “Housing Leasing Regulation of Beijing. He especially stressed the new article which came into effect last year: “(the lessor) shall not resort to power cuts, water cuts, heat supply cuts, and other such methods and shall not use threats of violence to force the lessee to change or terminate the lease contract.”
Power outage

Li Wenzu said in a Twitter video that the landlord removed the electricity meter and caused a power outage, leaving Wang’s house in darkness. The couple relied on candles and rechargeable lamps to maintain the light. “I never thought that in today’s civilized society, in Beijing, we would still live this kind of life using lit candles,” she said helplessly.
The real culprit

Wang Quanzhang revealed that there was no actual conflict between them and the landlord; it was just a simple landlord-tenant relationship. There is someone who instigated behind the scenes, and the landlord helped the evildoer. “Wherever we move,” he said,  “we face the problem of being forced to move out, and everyone can see who is the instigator behind the scenes.”
Li Heping evicted

Wang Qiaoling, the wife of Beijing human rights lawyer Li Heping, has a similar experience of being forced to relocate. She tweeted on April 26 that they were forced to leave Shunyi, Beijing. “We would like to live and work in peace and contentment, but there are always people who are unwilling and unhappy.”
Li’s statement

Lawyer Li Heping released a statement on the 25th:

After July 9, 2015, we were forced to move out of our residence seven times by the police. This recent time, in order to force us to move out of the district we are currently living in, the chief of the police station called a meeting of the real estate agent, demanding that the real estate agent not rent a place to my family, and not let us live in it even after signing the contract. My current residence was signed through a real estate agent. They threatened to revoke the agent’s business license and forced the agent to come to the house several times to force us to move out. They keep cornering us; they’re going to force us all the way to the moon!
German Foreign Minister’s visit

The Foreign Minister of Germany came to visit China earlier in April. During his visit, plainclothes officers blocked the front doors of Wang Quanzhang, Li Heping, Wang Yu, Bao Longjun, and others.
Yu Wensheng

Human rights lawyer Yu Wensheng and his wife, Xu Yan, were intercepted on their way to the German embassy after receiving an invitation to visit. The couple were both charged with “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” without having committed any illegal acts. Authorities then forced the couple to relocate.

There is someone who instigated behind the scenes, and the landlord helped the evildoer. “Wherever we move,” he said,  “we face the problem of being forced to move out, and everyone can see who is the instigator behind the scenes.”
Li Heping evicted

Wang Qiaoling, the wife of Beijing human rights lawyer Li Heping, has a similar experience of being forced to relocate. She tweeted on April 26 that they were forced to leave Shunyi, Beijing. “We would like to live and work in peace and contentment, but there are always people who are unwilling and unhappy.”
Li’s statement

Lawyer Li Heping released a statement on the 25th:

After July 9, 2015, we were forced to move out of our residence seven times by the police. This recent time, in order to force us to move out of the district we are currently living in, the chief of the police station called a meeting of the real estate agent, demanding that the real estate agent not rent a place to my family, and not let us live in it even after signing the contract. My current residence was signed through a real estate agent. They threatened to revoke the agent’s business license and forced the agent to come to the house several times to force us to move out. They keep cornering us; they’re going to force us all the way to the moon!
German Foreign Minister’s visit

The Foreign Minister of Germany came to visit China earlier in April. During his visit, plainclothes officers blocked the front doors of Wang Quanzhang, Li Heping, Wang Yu, Bao Longjun, and others.
Yu Wensheng

Human rights lawyer Yu Wensheng and his wife, Xu Yan, were intercepted on their way to the German embassy after receiving an invitation to visit.

29,Thailand,Thailand: pro-democracy defender sentenced on royal defamation charges,02/05/2023,"Activist Nawat Liangwattana has been sentenced to 1 years and 7 months in prison on a royal defamation charge for a speech given at a protest on 13 February 2021.

Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR) reported that Nawat was charged with royal defamation, destruction of property, blocking a public road, violation of the Emergency Decree, violation of the Public Cleanliness Act, and using a sound amplifier without permission for his participation in the protest.

He was indicted on 8 December 2021, after the public prosecutor ruled that calling for monarchy reform, demanding that the King must be under the Constitution, and questioning how the royal family uses taxpayers’ money is not an expression of opinion in good faith and can damage King Vajiralongkorn’s reputation.

On Wednesday (26 April), the Criminal Court sentenced Nawat to 3 years in prison for royal defamation. He was also sentenced to 2 months in prison and a fine of 2000 baht for destruction of property, and a fine of 1000 baht for using a sound amplifier without permission, although TLHR noted that the maximum fine as stated in the Sound Amplifier Act is 200 baht.

Because he confessed, the Court reduced his total sentence to 1 years and 7 months in prison and a fine of 1500 baht, but did not suspend his sentence since he had committed the same offences many times.

Nawat is facing 18 charges for joining pro-democracy protests, including 4 counts of royal defamation. This is the first time he has been found guilty and sentenced to prison. He was later granted bail using a 100,000-baht security, which the Court will confiscate if he violates his bail contract.",Freedom of assembly

30,China,"China: Tibetan WHRD, her husband arrested once again",15/05/2023,"On 3 May, Gonpo Kyi shared a video decrying the unjust verdict against her brother Dorje Tashi. Kyi says in the video, “Both the masses and leaders must abide by the law of the country. Here, however, the leaders do not follow the law and are not punished while the masses are subjected to punitive measures. The court did not respond to my petitions calling for its judges to be held accountable and penalised for not following the rule of law. Instead, the petitions were snatched from our hands and thrown into the dustbin. If common people like us did such a thing, we would have been accused of breaching various laws and subjected to numerous punitive measures.” 

This comes within a week after her detention in police custody for staging a relentless series of protests against the Chinese judicial authorities, specifically the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) Higher People’s Court, which passed the verdict on Dorje Tashi. On 26 April, Gonpo Kyi and her spouse were apprehended by the Public Security Bureau (PSB) officers in Lhasa and were released the following night on 27 April, reported exile Tibetan sources. During their detention, they were reportedly subjected to physical abuse, rigorous questioning and warned not to engage in such activities in the future. Instead Gonpo Kyi responded, “I will continue to protest until they kill me.”

Unfazed by police beatings and intimidation, Gonpo Kyi staged a protest in front of the TAR Higher People’s Court on 23 and 24 April. She demanded a fair and just trial for her brother Dorje Tashi, whose case was marred with allegations of false conviction and judicial irregularities. Notwithstanding the peaceful nature of the demonstration, the authorities attempted to suppress her voice by covering her protest with long black sheets. 

Earlier on 20 March, Kyi stood outside the TAR Higher People’s Court wearing a white shirt on which was written a slogan in Mandarin Chinese: “The allegations made by the Tibet Autonomous Region Higher People’s Court against Dorje Tashi are false!” In her hand, she held a copy of the verdict against Dorje Tashi. Her protest was short-lived when the Lhasa PSB officers arbitrarily detained her overnight and subjected her to beatings and interrogation.

A day later, on 21 March, a video clip surfaced on social media showing the police beating up Gonpo Kyi in front of the police station.

Following this, on 26 March, Kyi returned to the site of the protest to call for the verdict against her brother to be overturned and for her brother to meet his family members. 

On 31 March, Dorje Tseten, brother of Dorje Tashi, was summoned to the Lhasa PSB office, where he was informed that regardless of the numerous discussions about the wrongful conviction of Dorje Tashi, there was no possibility of overturning the verdict. Furthermore, Dorje Tseten was threatened with harsh punitive measures if he or anyone else continued to protest against the verdict. 

Gonpo Kyi recorded a video just prior to the protest of 20 March, which later circulated widely on the internet. In the video, she says, “I have spoken about this issue and introduced myself numerous times. It is now common knowledge. I am the sister of Dorje Tashi, the owner of Yak Hotel. In 2008, both of my siblings were arrested. Dorje Tsetan was sentenced to six years in prison, as indicated by the verdict document. My other sibling has been in prison for fifteen years now. The verdict was made 15 years ago by Norbu Dhondup, a judge from the TAR- Higher People’s Court, along with Penpa Lhamo and Pasang. At the same time, a Chinese couple, He Xingyou and his wife, were convicted of mortgage fraud worth 53 million yuan and sentenced to only 15 years in prison and released after serving just ten years. But my brother Dorje Tashi, who has been falsely accused of the same crime, remains behind bars despite repaying his total loans.”

It’s been 15 years since Dorje Tashi has been unjustly imprisoned for life for false loan fraud charges. Despite numerous appeals for a just trial and case revision, he remains behind bars. His family is not allowed to meet with him or to appeal to higher authorities about his case.

Both Gonpo Kyi and Dorje Tseten have resorted to peaceful protests in front of the TAR Higher People’s Court and carried out protests in the form of open letters and video messages to expose the names of those responsible for the unfair trial.

The Chinese authorities’ repeated detention and intimidation of Gonpo Kyi, a peaceful protester demanding justice for her brother Dorje Tashi, clearly violates her fundamental right to protest and expression. Such actions are not only contrary to the law, but they also show a blatant disregard for fundamental human rights.

TCHRD calls on the Chinese authorities to respect the fundamental rights of Gonpo Kyi and all Tibetans. We condemn the cowardly and unlawful acts of the Lhasa PSB authorities for intimidating and threatening Dorje Tseten and his family members for merely exercising their basic human rights and demanding justice for Dorje Tashi, who is in prison for a crime he did not commit. We demand that the authorities cease their harassment of Gonpo Kyi and address her grievances, as a responsible government must. It has been proven through expert legal analyses that Dorje Tashi was unjustly imprisoned and disproportionately sentenced in a politically motivated verdict.

On 25 April 2023, the Investigative Committee of the Republic of Kyrgyztan moved to press additional charges against all representatives of the Committee to Protect Kempir-Abad water reserve, including women human rights defenders Gulnara Dzhurabayeva, Klara Sooronkulova, Rita Karasartova and Asya Sasykbayeva. All representatives, targeted since October 2022, are now being accused of “forcible seizure of power” a criminal offense stipulated by the Article 326 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan. Under this article alone women human rights defenders can face up to 15 years of prison time.

32,Cambodia,Cambodia: relatives of social media activist publicly threatened by the prime minister,26/04/2023,"Prime Minister Hun Sen on Tuesday threatened to fire the relatives of a popular Cambodian online activist based in France who has been highly critical of the longtime leader and the government.

Thousands of viewers watch Sorn Dara’s talk shows on Facebook during which he routinely attacks Hun Sen and calls for his removal from office. His father is a military officer and a longtime supporter of the ruling Cambodian People’s Party and and his sister-in-law works at the Ministry of Interior. 

“You want to try me if your parents don’t teach you lessons. I will fire your parents – including your relatives – from their jobs,” Hun Sen said at a graduation ceremony in Phnom Penh. “You are so rude. I will invite your father and your sister-in-law to learn some lessons and don’t complain that I am taking your relatives as hostages,” an apparent reference to firing them.

Sorn Dara lives in exile in France and is seeking asylum there. He most recently criticized Hun Sen for promising free admission to people and participants during the upcoming Southeast Asia Games, which are being held in Cambodia next month.

The move has been criticized as a way to curry favor with voters ahead of July’s parliamentary election.

Following his threats on Tuesday, Hun Sen posted videos of Sorn Dara’s mother and brother on Telegram saying they were disappointed that Sorn Dara hasn’t joined the CPP. 

‘You insult your parents’

Hun Sen also spoke publicly about Sorn Dara in February, saying that he wasn’t a good son because he didn’t listen to his parents.

“You insult your parents to whom you owe gratitude saying they have less education than you,” he said. “Your parents gave birth to you. You still look down on them. How about the regular people? If you don’t recognize your parents, then you are not human.”

Sorn Dara is a former official of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party, which was dissolved by the Supreme Court in November 2017. He said his father disowned him that same year because he had refused to join the CPP.  

Sorn Dara’s father, Col. Sok Sunnareth, deputy chief of staff of the Kampong Speu Provincial Operations Area and a ruling party working group official, publicly implored his son on Feb. 22 to stop criticizing Hun Sen and his government, according to a Khmer Times report. 

On Tuesday, Sorn Dara responded to Hun Sen’s latest angry threat with a Facebook post that said the prime minister should act in a more mature manner and lead the country with dignity.

Speaking to Radio Free Asia, Sorn Dara noted that Hun Sen has recently been using threats and tricks against political opponents as the election looms. 

“I don’t want to be associated with my family. They are different from me,” he said. “No one can stop me from doing something.”

‘I will try to advise my brother’

Sorn Dara’s parents appeared in a short video in February posted by the pro-government Fresh News, saying they had severed ties with their son.

His brother, Sorn Saratt, told RFA on Tuesday that he has also cut ties with him. But he said he will try to convince his brother to defect from the opposition party and join the CPP.

“I will try to advise my brother to stop attacking the King, the government and Samdech [Hun Sen], to stay away from traitors and return to the family and the country,” he said.

Ros Sotha, executive director of the Cambodian Human Rights Action Committee, told RFA that Hun Sen’s threat isn’t legitimate. He urged the prime minister to be patient and to avoid violating human rights and the law.

“As a leader, he shouldn’t be afraid of being criticized,” he said. “There is no law that [Sorn Dara’s relatives] will be fired because they are related to members of the opposition party.”",Right to work

In videos received by Tibet Watch on 25 April, Gonmo Kyi can be seen holding up a sign as police try to hide her from view by surrounding her with black material.

In the background of one video, Dorjee Tseten, brother of Dorjee Tashi and Gonmo Kyi, can be heard saying: “Today, my sister is forcibly covered into this black cloth, because she refuses to leave and keeps protesting in front of the court.”

This is followed by two more videos, in which Dorjee Tseten says:

“She [Gonmo Kyi] protests for a fair trial for her brother’s case but the court opposed his fair trial. Some Chinese security personnel concealed her with black cloth”, and:

Hello everyone, just take a look, this is Dorjee Tashi’s sister Gonmo Kyi. She keeps calling for fair trial for her brother, but Tibet Higher People’s Court not only defined the fair trial but also covered her with black cloth and detained her.”",Right to Protest

35,Kazakhstan,Kazakhstan: 2024 Women’s March prohibited,01/05/2023,"On 21 April 2023, the Specialised Inter-district Administrative Court of Almaty ruled in support of
the prohibition of the International Women’s Day March in 2024 by the Akimat (local government)
of the city of Almaty, making this the third consecutive year that the march has been refused.
8MarchKZ is a grassroots feminist human rights initiative in Almaty, Kazakhstan that unites for the
purpose of organising the annual feminist and women’s march in Almaty on 8 March. The
organising committee of the initiative includes a diverse group of women human rights defenders,
who work to promote and protect women and LGBTQI+ rights. The first Women’s March in Almaty
took place in 2017.
On 20 March 2023, the 8MarchKZ initiative submitted a notification to the Akimat about holding a
Women’s March on 8 March 2024, with the thematic focus of the March being “for the rights of the
women of Kazakhstan” which was refused by the Akimat of Almaty. During a court hearing on 12
April 2023, the Akim (local governor) of Almaty, Erbolat Dosayev, justified the decision to disallow
the march by stating that it is a threat to public security. The Akim of Almaty argued that the Akimat
received letters of concern from an unidentified representative of a group called On Legalisation of
Foreign Vehicles and from a concerned citizen of the Turkestan region of Kazakhstan, who called
to ban the “feminist movement from organising peaceful protests in the city of Almaty.” Eventually,
on 21 April 2023, the Specialised Inter-district Administrative Court of Almaty ruled in support of the
prohibition of the Women’s March in 2024 by the Akimat of the city of Almaty.
The local governing bodies of Almaty have a history of refusing women human rights defenders to
march on International Women’s Day. In 2022, the Akimat of Almaty refused to approve a Women’s
March due to alleged road works along the route. Women human rights defenders from 8MarchKZ
however, reported that no road works were actually happening on 8 March. In 2023, the Akimat of
Almaty once again refused to approve the march, citing that the route and the time-slot suggested
were already booked by another civil society actor.
Women human rights defenders who organise the Women’s March on 8 March have also been
targeted for their human rights work. In 2019, some organisers, who submittted individual requests
to the Akimat for the march to take place, received threats of expulsion from their educational
institutions unless they retracted their requests. In 2020, two of the march organisers, woman
human rights defenders Fariza Ozpan and Arina Osinovskaya were fined for the symbolic burning
of a flower wreath in commemoration of the vicitms of gender-based violence. Arina Osinovskaya
was fined for 66,000 KZT (approximately EUR 119) and Farisa Ospan for 13,000 KZT
(approximately EUR 26).
Front Line Defenders condemns the Akimat of Almaty’s refusal to approve the 2024 Women’s
March, as well as their denial of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly to feminist and women’s
rights defenders. Front Line Defenders calls upon the authorities of Kazakhstan to ensure that

36,Viet Nam,Vietnam: Ede minorities protesting a drainage project met with police violence,26/04/2023,"Swinging batons and bashing villagers, Vietnamese police dispersed dozens of members of the Ede ethnic group who were attempting to interfere with a drainage project they fear will discharge wastewater into a lake they depend on, sources told Radio Free Asia.

Three villagers were hospitalized and 12 were arrested, they said.

“They hit us, injuring seven people of whom three had to be hospitalized due to the injuries on their heads, mouths, ears and shoulders,” said a protester who requested anonymity for security reasons.

Ea M’ta lake in the southern province of Dak Lak will be the endpoint of a rainwater drainage system project proposed by the province’s Cu Kuin district, the provincial and district governments said.

But residents living nearby fear that in addition to rainwater, the project could also divert wastewater into the lake, which could harm the environment and flood surrounding areas. 

Though a local government task force reviewed the project and said that no major damage to the ecosystem or to water resources would result from it, the protesters do not trust the review, they said.

The clash with the police, armed with batons and shields, occurred on Thursday and Friday.

 A video filmed by a witness shows several dozen police officers confronting a similar number of residents, mostly women, carrying the Vietnamese flag. They were mostly speaking in the Ede language, but at times they also spoke Vietnamese.

 “We are determined to stop the District People’s Committee from discharging wastewater into the lake,” someone in the video said. “We can sacrifice our lives for this.We will resolutely protect [the lake].”

The protester who spoke with RFA said that the police shoved down a woman who was two months pregnant, and broke the shoulder of another protester who passed out shortly afterwards. 

Police also knocked down a man and kicked his head repeatedly until his ears and mouth began to bleed. 

The three people who were hospitalized returned to their homes on Monday, according to the source. Those who were arrested were all released after signing a paper pledging that they would not return to the protest or face prison.

Radio Free Asia attempted to contact Bui Hong Quy, chief of staff of Dak Lak provincial People's Committee and the Cu Kuin district People's Committee to verify the source’s account, but received no response.

According to state media, the drainage system project with a total investment of nearly 36.7 billion dong (U.S.$1.53 million) was approved by Dak Lak People's Committee in 2019. The nearly 4 kilometer (2.5 mile) drainage canal would begin at the Cu Kuin District Military Command and terminate at the lake.

The Dak Lak People’s Committee’s task force reviewed the project’s impacts on the environment, safety, and living conditions. The review indicated that the project would not negatively affect the environment, land, climate, and water sources serving residents living in the surrounding areas, state media said.

 Residents living near the lake, however, said the review did not reflect reality.

Y Quynh Buon Dap, a human rights and religious activist who lives in Thailand as a refugee, said residents were worried because the survey was not thorough and did not include areas that could be affected by the project in the future.

On April 20, authorities stated that they were determined to complete the final component of the project, and that all activities that would prevent its implementation would be seen as unlawful.",Right to Protest

RFA Viet reported that Mrs Be posted on their social media accounts and Youtube, that Party leaders of Phuc Trach village abused their power, used their power to appropriate public land worth 3 billion dong.

 

On her youtube channel 5 months ago, Mrs Be introduced herself as someone who 'is always loyal to the Party, who always follows the example set by President Ho Chi Minh, Party Chief Nguyen Phu Trong...', and 'had to tell the truth' about land-related wrongdoings by local Party officials even though many of her comrades told her to shut up or she might be jailed.

39,Afghanistan,Afghanistan: another WHRD temporarily arrested,25/04/2023,"Waheeda Mahrami, an Afghan women activist who was detained by the Taliban officials in the week, was released on Thursday, Afghanistan International reported.

Taliban had detained Waheeda Mahrami, a women activist on Monday, March 20 in Kabul, according to a source close to her. On March 8, the International Women’s Day Mahrami described the restrictions on Afghan women as “gender apartheid”, which eventually led to her detention.

It is reported that Mahrami had left her home on March 20 to attend an event celebrating the ancient New Year (Nowruz) festival, but never returned home since then.

The Taliban authorities have not yet commented about the woman activist’s arbitrary detention and her release so far.

Mahrami used to regularly participate in women’s protests in Kabul, demanding the restoration of Afghan women’s rights and freedom. With the resumption of universities and educational institutions for male students, Maharmi was one of the few female students who participated in a symbolic protest and led a book behind the closed gate of Kabul University.

The United Nations and the international community has described the ban on Afghan women’s education as gender apartheid, which would adversely affect half of the country’s total population.  

Meanwhile, the de facto authorities of Afghanistan are allegedly accused of arbitrary detentions, harassment, and mistreatment of rights activists, women activists, and journalists since the group’s return to power.",Right to liberty and security
40,Lao People's Democratic Republic,Lao PDR: defender arrested upon returning to home country,15/05/2023,"A human rights activist and member of the Thailand-based Free Laos group was arrested when he recently returned to Laos to visit his hometown, friends of the activist told Radio Free Asia.

Savang Phaleuth, in his 40s, has worked in Thailand for years, according to a friend. He traveled to Done Sart village in Song Khone district last month and was detained at his family’s home on April 20 and later taken to Savannakhet city, the friend said.  

“Friends had reminded him not to go home because Lao officials have identified him,” the friend said. “But he insisted on going.”

Laos deals severely with dissidents who call for democracy and respect for human rights in the one-party communist state, and Lao dissidents living abroad have been harshly punished after returning or being forced back to Laos.

The rights group Free Laos was set up by Lao workers and residents in Thailand to promote human rights and democracy in their home country. 

Savang had posted on social media about those issues in Laos. It’s unclear where he is being held or if he has been charged.

A village headman told RFA that someone named Savang was arrested in Done Sart on April 20 but the reason was unknown. 

A source who is close to a high ranking police officer in Savannakhet province told RFA that Savang was arrested for his political campaign work.

“The police took Savang away but I don’t know where he is detained,” the source said. “First of all, he must be questioned for more details.”

Previous arrests of Thai-based Laotians

The co-founder of Free Laos, Khoukham Keomanivong, urged the Lao government to respect people’s rights and to not treat rights activists as traitors. 

Khoukham, a U.N.-recognized refugee, was convicted last year in a closed-door Thai trial of overstaying his visa and had been held pending deportation to Laos, where he faced arrest for his advocacy work. He was later released on bail and was finally allowed to leave Thailand for Canada, where he now lives. 

“We don’t like that the government treats people with different opinions as enemies,” he said. “It’s a severe abuse of human rights when people who express opinions different from the government are arrested and then disappear.”

Savang’s arrest is reminiscent of three rights activists who were arrested in Laos in March 2016.

Somphone Pimmasone, 29, Lodkham Thammavong, 30, and Soukane Chaithad, 32, were arrested after entering Laos to renew their passports from Thailand, where they had been working. 

They were charged with criticizing the Lao government online while working abroad and for taking part in a protest outside the Lao embassy in Thailand. The three were handed prison terms described by rights groups as harsh at a secret trial in April 2017.

In another case, democracy activist Od Sayavong, a friend of Khoukham, vanished under mysterious circumstances in Bangkok in 2019 after posting a video clip online criticizing the government. 

Listed as a “person of concern” by the UNHCR because of his advocacy for democracy and human rights, his whereabouts remain unknown. He was 34 at the time he went missing.

Vientiane shooting

Meanwhile, police said on Monday that a preliminary investigation into the April 29 shooting of a Lao political activist in Vientiane indicates it was related to either a business or romantic dispute.

That statement was met with skepticism from Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch and others who questioned whether Lao authorities were serious about investigating the attack on Jack Anousa.

Anousa, 25, has been the administrator of a Facebook group that’s uncovered and denounced human rights abuses and has called for the end of one-party rule in Laos.

Security camera footage that was later posted on the Facebook group page showed an unidentified gunman, wearing a cap and beige jacket, firing two shots at Anousa at a Vientiane shop. 

The same Facebook page said Anousa died at a hospital the next day, but that report proved to be false after Anousa’s family and other sources gave verbal confirmation and photographic evidence that he survived the shooting. The identity of the gunman remains unknown and no arrest has been made.

“Coming to such a quick, convenient conclusion without doing a thorough investigation is just the sort of pathetically poor performance we’ve come to expect from the Lao police,” Robertson said on Monday. “This looks like the start of the Lao government cover-up rather than the sort of thorough and impartial investigation that is truly needed to find the shooter and anyone else connected with him.”

Bounthone Chanthalavong-Weiser, president of the Germany-based Alliance for Democracy in Laos, said Anousa was an employee, not a business owner – so a business conflict was unlikely. 

“He also didn’t have a love conflict with anyone,” she said. “He was shot because he was fighting for democracy and human rights in Laos. The Lao government just doesn’t like these people.”",Right to liberty and security
41,Nepal,Nepal: media workers prevented from reporting,02/05/2023,"Police officers obstructed three journalists from reporting in Jhapa on April 19. Jhapa lies in the Koshi Province of Nepal.

Journalists Chiranjibi Ghimire (Nayapatrika National daily), Bishnu Prasad Pokharel (Gorkhapatra National daily) and Sudeep Adhikari (HImshikhar TV) were barred from reporting the ongoing protest in Om Mechi Hospital, Jhapa.

As a woman died during her delivery, her families staged a protest for alleged carelessness of medical professionals during her treatment. On the day of incident, hospital administration and victim families held discussion upon the case to stop the protest.

The journalists reached the site to report on the protest and ongoing discussion but the police officer on-duty stopped and asked them to return back.

""We showed them our press identity cards and requested but in vain. Even the public demanded that journalists should be present in the discussion and make the information public. But the police officers did not let us enter. One of the officer also pushed back reporter Ghimire. Till today (April 21), we donot have any official information,"" shared one of the journalists Bishnu Pokharel with Freedom Forum.

""Mayor of Damak Municipality also ordered the police officers not to let the reporters enter the place"", said journalist Pokharel. 

Freedom Forum is concerned over the incident as it is violation of press freedom. Obstructing journalists from reporting is against journalists' right to free reporting and also serious violation of citizen's right to information. FF strongly urges the concerned authority to respect journalists' right and ensure free reporting atmosphere in future.",Freedom of movement
42,Pakistan,"Pakistan: media worker abducted, tortured",07/05/2023,"Journalist Gohar Wazir was shopping for groceries at a market in northwestern Pakistan when five men forced him into a vehicle at gunpoint.

The abductors blindfolded Wazir and whisked him away to a hideout some 40 minutes away from the city of Bannu. For the next 30 hours, Wazir was kept in a dark bathroom, where he says he was tortured.

“I was whipped incessantly by one person while another filmed the beating,” Wazir told RFE/RL’s Radio Mashaal. ""When they got tired from beating me, they began giving me electric shocks. I was losing consciousness.”

The 40-year-old said the torture only stopped when he agreed to record a video pledging to stop criticizing the powerful Pakistani military and the pro-government militants that are allegedly on its payroll.

Wazir blamed the state-backed militants, locally known as the “good Taliban,” for his April 19 abduction. These militants are mostly former members of the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) extremist group, which have been dubbed the “bad Taliban” by the authorities. The TTP has waged a deadly insurgency against Islamabad for years.

Tasked with combating the TTP, also known as the Pakistani Taliban, the state-backed militants have been accused of extortion, kidnappings, and the harassment of activists and journalists in northwestern Pakistan, according to observers.

""They can kill me at any time,"" said Wazir, adding that the pro-government militants often act with impunity.

'Stop Covering Protests'

Wazir’s abduction and alleged torture have cast a spotlight on the rising number of attacks on journalists in Pakistan, one of the deadliest countries in the world for reporters and media workers.

It is not the first time that Wazir, known for his criticism of the authorities and the various militant groups present in the region, has been targeted for his work.

In 2019, when he worked for the private Khyber News television station, Wazir was briefly detained after covering a meeting of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM). The civil organization campaigns for the rights of Pakistan’s estimated 35 million Pashtuns, many of whom live along the border with Afghanistan.Since its emergence in 2018, the PTM has earned the wrath of the authorities by accusing the military of employing state-backed militants to fight the TTP and silence government critics. Locals, who have staged numerous protests over the years, have also accused the army of committing human rights abuses during its military campaigns.

During his 15-year journalism career, Wazir has covered PTM rallies, the military’s deadly offensives in the region, and the activities of state-backed militants.

""I was repeatedly told to stop covering protests where the issue of dismantling pro-government militant groups is always a major demand,"" said Wazir, referring to one of the key demands of his abductors.

'Dangerous Pattern Of Impunity'

Police in Bannu said they have launched an investigation into Wazir’s abduction and alleged torture.

Global media watchdogs, including Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and the Committee To Protect Journalists (CPJ), have called on Pakistan to conduct a swift and impartial investigation.

In the May 2 statement, CPJ's Asia program coordinator, Beh Lih Yi, called on Islamabad to ""take serious steps to end a dangerous pattern of impunity related to violence against journalists.""

Wazir is the latest journalist in Pakistan to be targeted amid mounting censorship and crackdowns against dissent.

The Freedom Network, an Islamabad-based independent media watchdog, said attacks on journalists in Pakistan rose by more than 60 percent in the past year.

In its annual report released on May 1, the watchdog said that it documented 140 cases of threats and attacks against journalists. At least five journalists were killed, the group said.

43,India,India: community-based defender threatened,25/04/2023,"Through this letter, I want to attract your immediate attention to a case of intimidation and harassment by the state agencies on a Human Rights Defender (HRD), Mr. Arkadeep Goswami aged about 28 years, S/o Mr. Madan Gopal Goswami, a resident of 158/2, Parui Kancha Road, Kolkata 700061 in the state of West Bengal. This intimidation and harassment by the state agencies upon the HRD is probable infringement of his right to liberty and freedom of expression.

 

Since 18 years of age, Mr. Arkadeep Goswami has been active in Socio-political movements. He was a student activist during his college days. He was an executive member of All India Council for Student Struggles. In 2017 he was a member of ‘All India University Students Fact Finding Team on Fake Encounters’ and few other national consolidations. In 2014 he associated in ‘Hok kolorob’ movement, From 2016 to 2018 he joined in the movement called ‘Justice for Rohith Vemula’. Mr. Goswami always stands for the human rights of the people in the country and raises his voice against the extremist and fascist politics.

 

In the year 2018 when Mr. Arkadeep Goswami did fact finding on the political prisoner in the West Medinipur district in the state of West Bengal, the state government charged him in a fabricated case vide Goaltore Police Station case number 220/2018 dated 13.11.2018 under section 149 (Unlawful assembly) /120B (Criminal conspiracy) /121 (Waging war against the Government) /121A (Conspiracy to commit offence u/s 121) /123 (Concealing with intent to facilitate design to wage war) /124A (Sedition) of Indian Penal Code. It is a fact that after passing the four years’ time, the police failed to submit charge sheet against Mr. Goswami.

In the year 2022, when Mr. Goswami used to stay at Bolpur in Birbhum district of West Bengal with his wife, on 24th April, 2022, he was kidnapped by some officials of Special Task Force (STF) and Counter Insurgency Force under the instruction of the then-Superintendent of Police, CIF, Durgapur Range, and was taken illegally almost 200 KM far to the Barikul PS and slapped with a fabricated case vide Barikul Police Station case number 04/2022 dated 27.01.2022 under section 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon) /149 (Unlawful assembly) /120B (Criminal conspiracy) /121 (waging war against the Government) /121A (Conspiracy to commit offence u/s 121) /122 (Collecting arms with intent to wage war against the Government) /123 (Concealing with intent to facilitate design to wage war) /124A (Sedition) of Indian Penal Code of sedition. During the time of apprehension no memo of arrest was prepared and no legal formalities were not followed by the personnel of that state agency. Till date no charge sheet was submitted by the police against Mr. Goswami in connection with this case.

 

Mr. Arkadeep Goswami is now working as a freelance journalist and also working with a reputed human rights organization in the country, Banglar Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha (MASUM). As his voice sometimes goes against the establishment, he has been systematically targeted and charged with fabricated cases. These repeated incidents are violating his Constitutional rights as a citizen and also as a Human rights Defender.

 

Now, On 18.04.2023, while he was at the office of Banglar Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha (MASUM), two suspicious people, one told his name as Sandipan Mondal, gave a visit to his house placed at 158/2, Parui Kancha Road, Kolkata, around 3 O'clock in the afternoon. They told his parents that they are the friends of Mr. Goswami and want to talk to him about some unspecified things. They asked his mother to call him and when his mother called Mr. Goswami, they questioned about his whereabouts incessantly. Upon asking their identity and address, they didn't come up with any satisfactory answer. Later, they repeatedly asked Mr. Goswami by which time he will return home. When Mr. Goswami refused to divulge any information to them, they said, ""So you won't talk to us? Okay, we will see you.” The man identified himself as Sandipan Mondal. Mr. Arkadeep Goswami categorically doesn't have any friends or acquaintances by this name (Sandipan Mondal) but that person also told him that they met Mr. Goswami at Barikul Police Station, last year, when he was there in police custody on a fabricated charge. Mr. Goswami informed that he had not met anybody else during that time apart from officials from different state agencies.

 

The voice which he heard in phone call and physical appearance of the person which he was informed by his mother, from that Mr. Goswami identified that in yesterday's call was similar to one of those kidnappers associated with intelligence branches (state agencies) when he was fabricated with false charges in Barikul Police Station.

 

Mr. Goswami apprehended that the person from the state agencies tried to apprehend him and therefore they intimidate and harass him continuously without any reason. As he is now involved himself as human rights movement which raises voice against human rights violation by the state apparatus, he has been targeted planfully.

 

The incident also violates the rights guaranteed in Article 19 (i) (a) (Freedom of speech) and Article 21(Right to life) of Indian Constitution. The incident also violates the Govt. of India's obligation to adhere to the United Nations' declaration on Human Rights Defenders (General Assembly Resolution A/RES/53/144) that obliges the government to protect, promote and implement human rights within the country.",Right to healthy and safe environment
44,China,China: Hong Kongese leading figure gets additional prison term,02/05/2023,"One of the most prominent democracy activists in Hong Kong over recent years, Joshua Wong, was sentenced today to three months in prison over an information breach involving a police officer, according to a post on Wong’s Facebook account.

The 26-year-old rose to prominence in 2014, when, as a bespectacled teenager, he emerged as a leader of student-led democracy protests in which roads in the heart of the financial centre were blocked for 79 days.

In today’s ruling, he was sentenced for breaching a court ban on disclosing personal information about a police officer who opened fire at a protest in 2019, according to the post.

Wong attended the hearing but did not speak, a witness in the court said.

The court did not immediately publish a written judgement, delivering only an oral sentencing today. Wong’s lawyer was not immediately available for comment.

Wong galvanised international support for the former British colony’s pro-democracy movement, meeting politicians from the US, Europe and elsewhere, and drawing the wrath of Beijing, which says he is a “black hand” of foreign forces.

Wong was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize in 2018 for his role in the 2014 protests, known as the Umbrella movement because of the umbrellas protesters wielded to protect themselves from water cannon and tear gas.

Wong is one of 47 pro-democracy figures who have been charged with conspiracy to commit subversion, under a national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020, for participating in an unofficial primary election that year.

""This ointment is made in Taiwan, and is available on a number of e-commerce platforms in China, and ... isn't a medicine in the true sense – it's more of a wellbeing product that is ... only for external use,"" Shangguan Keke said.

""All he did was put up an advertisement so people could contact him [to buy it],"" he said. 

Shangguan Keke said his father was detained following an apparent sting operation.

""On April 13 and 14, people from two addresses near the Ezhou municipal police department contacted my dad and said they wanted to buy the ointment,"" he said. ""When they had done so, my dad was arrested.""

Shangguan Yunkai is currently being held at a police-run detention center, where officers are refusing to allow a lawyer hired by his family to meet with him.

""The reception staff at the detention center told me that there was a note on the detention center system saying that Shangguan Yunkai wasn't to be allowed to meet with any lawyers,"" Shangguan Keke said.

""After we filed a complaint with the local state prosecutor, both our family and our lawyer received various kinds of threats,"" he said.

He said he was contacted and warned ""not to kick up a big fuss"" around the case, and warned that he would be held responsible for ""online words and deeds.""

Reporter who investigated graft

57-year-old Shangguan Yunkai, a former journalist at state-run paper the Rule of Law Daily, was detained after writing books, blog posts and social media posts taking aim at official corruption.

Some of his investigations had led to investigations and the punishment of hundreds of local officials and members of criminal organizations.

Lawyer Li Qinglilang, who has been following the case, said his detention was likely a form of political retaliation for his reporting.

""He's an investigative reporter, and his work has prompted the downfall of hundreds of corrupt officials,"" Li said.

""Selling [ointment and ointment-infused] plasters is very common in China,"" he said. ""I am guessing that his detention is due to selective and retaliatory law enforcement.""

""They use a formula that entails strict laws, widespread violation and selective enforcement,"" he said, adding that the ""counterfeit medicines"" charge is a way of avoiding a more political charge like ""picking quarrels and stirring up trouble,"" and defusing public reaction to Shangguan's case.

The charges carry similar maximum sentences of up to three years' imprisonment.

In February 2022, Shangguan wrote an article revealing that Wang Bokun, who had been promoted to deputy director of the Huanggang Municipal People's Congress, had transferred benefits to his private household during his tenure as Luotian County Communist Party Secretary, prompting Wang's dismissal.

He also exposed violations of party discipline and law by Zhang Jingping, Huanggang People's Court judge and executive deputy mayor of Ezhou's Huangzhou district.

Shangguan Yunkai also ran a number of WeChat groups collecting clues and evidence against officials in smaller, prefecture-level cities in the region.

His detention came as official figures showed that more than 770,000 complaints of corruption were received by the Chinese Communist Party's disciplinary arm in the first quarter of 2023, with 111,000 leading to punishments for officials, including nine at the provincial and ministerial level in the space of just 21 days.

Yu Wensheng and his wife, Xu Yan, were detained on Thursday and whisked away in a police car to a police station “for going to an embassy,” Xu said in a video posted on her Twitter account.

In one of the clips, not accessible in China where Twitter is banned, Xu explained how they were forced into the car by “various people.”

The EU delegation in China said it lodged a complaint with China’s foreign ministry “against this unacceptable treatment.”

“We demand their immediate, unconditional release,” the EU embassy tweeted.

Yu was sentenced in 2020 to four years in prison for “inciting subversion of state power” and was released in March 2022.

Yu has a track record of high-profile human rights cases including the defense of Falun Gong practitioners, a banned religious group since 1999.

He represented people arrested in 2015 during the so-called 709-crackdown that saw Chinese authorities conduct a series of coordinated mass arrests across the country targeting human rights lawyers and activists.

The EU delegation also demanded the release of lawyers Wang Quanzhang, Wang Yu, and Bao Longjun, who are “under house arrest.”

Wang Yu was arrested in 2015 with over 300 human rights lawyers and activists during the 709-crackdown and was released on bail a year later. She has remained under the strict supervision of authorities ever since.

48,Viet Nam,Vietnam: blogger in refuge abducted and forced to return to Vietnam,19/04/2023,"A prominent YouTuber, Duong Van Thai was reportedly abducted in Bangkok on orders from the Vietnamese government and forcibly returned to Vietnam. The incident is believed to have occurred around April 14, 2023 — the same day that US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, arrived in Hanoi.

Duong Van Thai (who publishes under the name Thai Van Duong) was granted political refugee status by the United Nations as he sought safety in Thailand. The Vietnamese authorities had threatened to prosecute him due to videos posted on social media that revealed sensitive information about power struggles within the Communist Party.

In 2018, Duong Van Thai fled to Thailand and applied for refugee status, waiting to be relocated to a third country under the UN Refugee Resettlement program. In a statement released on April 16, Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security claimed that Duong Van Thai was arrested for illegally re-entering the country. Fellow activists and Vietnamese asylum seekers in Thailand dispute the official account of the arrest, arguing that Duong Van Thai would not have voluntarily returned to Vietnam, given the risks of persecution and imprisonment he would face.

In December 2017, Vietnamese intelligence agents abducted Trinh Xuan Thanh in Berlin. Thanh was a former Vietnamese government official who fled to Germany where he sought asylum. In February 2019, Vietnamese security abducted blogger Truong Duy Nhat in Bangkok where he was under asylum process; Truong Duy Nhat was subsequently sentenced to 10 years for “defrauding the public.”

In recent years, hundreds of Vietnamese activists and persecuted Christians have fled to Thailand. Many of them are waiting for resettlement in a third country. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees needs to grant protection to these asylum seekers and accelerate procedures to bring them out of reach of the Vietnamese security forces.

The international community needs to investigate the cases of Duong Van Thai and Truong Duy Nhat and bring to justice the people responsible for transnational repression.

On April 13, Thai, an independent journalist who posts political commentary on YouTube and has about 119,000 followers, went missing in Bangkok, Thailand, according to multiple news reports.

He had lived in Thailand as a refugee since 2020 and visited the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ office hours before his disappearance, according to those reports and Nguyen Van Hai, a colleague familiar with Thai’s situation and CPJ’s 2013 International Press Freedom Award winner, who communicated with CPJ via email.

On April 16, Vietnamese state media reported that Thai had been arrested while allegedly trying to enter Vietnam and was being held by police in the Huong Son district of central Ha Tinh province.

“Vietnamese authorities must immediately release journalist Duong Van Thai and disclose the exact details of his detention,” said Shawn Crispin, CPJ’s senior Southeast Asia representative. “Vietnam has a history of targeting journalists living in exile. Thai authorities should thoroughly and transparently investigate the circumstances of his disappearance in Bangkok, and ensure that members of the press are not targeted for their work.”

Those Vietnamese state media reports alleged that Thai was arrested while attempting to illegally enter Vietnam on April 14. CPJ called and emailed Thai after his arrest was announced but did not receive any replies.

48,Viet Nam,Vietnam: blogger in refuge abducted and forced to return to Vietnam,19/04/2023,"A prominent YouTuber, Duong Van Thai was reportedly abducted in Bangkok on orders from the Vietnamese government and forcibly returned to Vietnam. The incident is believed to have occurred around April 14, 2023 — the same day that US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, arrived in Hanoi.

Duong Van Thai (who publishes under the name Thai Van Duong) was granted political refugee status by the United Nations as he sought safety in Thailand. The Vietnamese authorities had threatened to prosecute him due to videos posted on social media that revealed sensitive information about power struggles within the Communist Party.

In 2018, Duong Van Thai fled to Thailand and applied for refugee status, waiting to be relocated to a third country under the UN Refugee Resettlement program. In a statement released on April 16, Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security claimed that Duong Van Thai was arrested for illegally re-entering the country. Fellow activists and Vietnamese asylum seekers in Thailand dispute the official account of the arrest, arguing that Duong Van Thai would not have voluntarily returned to Vietnam, given the risks of persecution and imprisonment he would face.

49,Kazakhstan,Kazakhstan: media worker and HRD arrested,01/05/2023,"On 12 April 2023, human rights defender and journalist Lukpan Akhmedyarov was detained and
sentenced to 15 days of administrative detention. Law enforcement officers stopped Lukpan
Akhmedyarov’s car on the road, and informed him that he was being detained for violating the
rules on public protest, an administrative offence envisioned by Article 488, part 7, of the Civic
Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan. On the same day he was sentenced to 15 days

50,Viet Nam,Vietnam: Blogger sentenced to 6 years on anti-state propaganda (Update),20/04/2023,"The Hanoi People’s Court on Wednesday sentenced prominent political activist and blogger Nguyen Lan Thang to six years in prison and two years of probation – the latest conviction in a continuing crack down on dissenting voices in the one-party communist country. 

Thang, a long-time contributor of blog posts on politics and society to RFA’s Vietnamese service, was arrested in July 2022 and charged with spreading anti-state propaganda. He is one of four jailed Radio Free Asia contributors in Vietnam. 

Only four defense lawyers and Thang’s wife, Le Bich Vuong, were allowed inside the courtroom for the trial. Vuong told RFA that he didn’t admit to the charge of opposing the State during the five-hour long proceeding.

Thang was accused of “making, storing, spreading or propagating anti-state information, documents, items and publications opposing the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.” The charge against him came under Article 117 of Vietnam’s criminal code, which is often used by authorities to suppress free speech on social media.

“All of my family members were very sad, as we all believe in his innocence,” Le Bich Vuong told RFA. “What he did was for the betterment of society.”

RFA President Bay Fang said the conviction was “a miscarriage of justice and an assault on free expression in Vietnam” and called for his immediate release and for all charges to be dropped.

“The outrageous harassment he has endured and his sentencing to six years in prison demonstrate the extent to which Vietnamese authorities will go to silence independent journalists and voices,” she said in a statement on Wednesday. 

Security tightened during trial-
Many of Thang’s relatives, friends and activists weren’t allowed near the court. Some political dissidents and family members of prisoners of conscience were under tight house watch or were followed by local security forces if they left home during the trial. 

Thang originally feared the case would be held in a closed courtroom and petitioned last month for an open trial.

The 48-year-old has written several articles on freedom, democracy and human rights on the RFA Vietnamese blog since late 2013. He has also taken part in protests defending Vietnam’s sovereignty in disputed areas of the South China Sea and worked to help people affected by floods and storms in the country’s Central Highlands.

In April 2022, he wrote for RFA about news reports that Russian ships had been turning off their locator systems to evade being tracked for illegal oil sales. He recalled that during the Iraq War, tycoons from a certain “socialist-oriented market economy” had repainted oil ships to buy sanctioned Iraqi oil at a discount and “became very very rich.” 

The indictment said that Thang allegedly “stored” several books with anti-State content, including “Politics for Commoners” and “Non-violent Resistance,” both written by human rights activist and journalist Pham Doan Trang, who is serving a nine-year jail term on the same charge of “propagandizing against the State.”

Trang also allegedly participated in many roundtable discussions by BBC, which contained contents thought to have sabotaged or smeared the Vietnamese government. He was also said to have published 12 videos distorting the communist regime on Facebook and YouTube platforms. 

“Nguyen Lan Thang shared his perspectives and opinions online with a sense of responsibility and duty, but never with malice or disrespect,” Bay Fang said. “Nevertheless he is among four RFA contributors in Vietnam who have been ensnared by the government in an effort to censor and purge.” 

Vuong said Thang hadn’t made a decision on whether he would submit an appeal. That decision would be made in the next two weeks, she said. 

Could have faced 12 years imprisonment- 
The government held a closed trial to avoid embarrassment and because officials knew that Thang was innocent – and that his family has made many contributions to Vietnam’s communist regime, said Hieu Ba Linh and independent journalist who lives in Germany.

Thang is from a well-known academic family in Hanoi, and his grandfather wrote a popular Vietnamese dictionary. Under Article 117, he could have faced up to 12 years in prison.

“Apparently, the sentence of six-year imprisonment for Mr. Thang was pretty light,” Hieu Ba Linh said. “However, for a patriot like Mr. Thang, a day in prison is still a day of injustice and unfairness.”

His parents told RFA ahead of the trial that Thang “has never done anything wrong to his family, country and his own conscience.”

Earlier this week, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) issued statements calling on the Vietnamese government to drop the charges and immediately release Thang.

On Wednesday, the deputy Asia director at New York-based Human Rights Watch said the verdict showed once again that there is no justice or respect for human rights in Vietnam.

“Vietnam is systematically dismantling and imprisoning the network of political activists and NGO leaders who dare exercise their rights to demand reforms and improvements in the country,” Phil Robertson said. 

“The Vietnamese people will be the ultimate losers in this game as the party apparatchiks take advantage of the purge of whistleblowers to redouble the crony corruption of the ruling party,” he said.

According to the CPJ, Vietnam has detained 21 journalists for their professional activities as of Dec. 1, 2022. 

Before the trial, Vuong told RFA that her husband had “only exercised a citizen’s freedom of expression, press freedom, and responsibilities for protecting national sovereignty, environment, and human rights and fighting against injustice in society.”",Right to liberty and security
51,Kazakhstan,Kazakhstan: group of labour rights defenders detained,01/05/2023,"Police in Kazakhstan’s capital, Astana, have detained dozens of oil workers from the Central Asian nation's southwestern town of Zhanaozen, who were demanding jobs after their company lost a tender in recent weeks that would have provided work.

Artur Alkhasov of the Kazakh Bureau of Human Rights and Rule of Law told RFE/RL that more than 80 former workers of the BerAli Manghystau Company were detained on April 11 after they spent a night in front of the Energy Ministry's building, demanding jobs at the OzenMunaiGaz company, a subsidiary of the oil-rich nation's KazMunaiGaz energy giant.

The workers said they lost their jobs after their company had lost a tender for oil work in the energy-rich western region of Manghystau recently.

Last week, dozens of women in Zhanaozen staged a protest demanding permanent jobs for their sons and husbands, while hundreds of former oil-industry employees gathered in front of the offices of OzenMunaiGaz demanding jobs.

Zhanaozen was the scene of mass anti-government rallies in 2011 staged by oil workers that resulted in the deaths of at least 16 people when police opened fire on unarmed protesters.

In early January last year, other protests in the volatile town over abrupt energy price hikes quickly spread across the tightly controlled former Soviet republic and led to violent clashes in the country's largest city, Almaty, and elsewhere that left at least 238 people, including 19 law enforcement officers, dead.

President Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev then moved to deprive influential former President Nursultan Nazarbaev of his lifetime post atop the Kazakh Security Council, taking the post himself.

52,China,China: two prominent pro-democracy HRDs handed down lengthy jail term (Update),01/05/2023,"Chinese authorities should immediately quash the lengthy sentences on baseless charges handed down to two of China’s most prominent human rights lawyers and activists, Human Rights Watch said today. On April 10, 2023, a court in Shandong province sentenced Xu Zhiyong to 14 years in prison and Ding Jiaxi to 12 years after convicting each for the crime of “subversion of state power.” Their trials were conducted behind closed doors and riddled with procedural problems and allegations of mistreatment.

“The cruelly farcical convictions and sentences meted out to Xu Zhiyong and Ding Jiaxi show President Xi Jinping’s unstinting hostility towards peaceful activism,” said Yaqiu Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Governments around the world should join in calling on the Chinese authorities to release the two lawyers immediately and unconditionally.”

The authorities detained Ding, 55, in December 2019, after he and Xu participated in a gathering in Fujian province where a group of rights lawyers and activists discussed human rights and China’s political future. In February 2020, the police apprehended Xu in Guangzhou, where he had gone into hiding. Li Qiaochu, Xu’s partner and a Beijing-based women’s rights and labor activist, has been detained since February 2021 on suspicion of “inciting subversion of state power” and is awaiting trial.

Xu, 50, a former lecturer at the Beijing University of Post and Telecommunications, was a cofounder of the now-banned legal aid center Open Constitution Initiative and the New Citizens’ Movement, a nongovernmental group advocating for civil rights, government transparency, and education equality. Ding, a former commercial lawyer, played key roles in both groups.

For their activism, Ding was imprisoned from 2013 to 2016 and Xu served four years in prison, from 2014 to 2018.

Xu was a 2020 recipient of PEN America’s PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write Award. In 2023, the United States Department of State awarded Ding the Global Human Rights Defender Award.

He was arrested in Guangzhou on 15 February 2020 after having published an opinion piece critical of general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping and his handling of the Covid-19 crisis.

Xu was sentenced along with civil rights activist Ding Jiaxi, who received 12 years prison term, after a closed-door trial which took place in June 2022. Both have reportedly been deprived of water, food and sleep, and subjected to prolonged interrogations on the ""tiger chair"", a notorious instrument of torture used by the Chinese police, during detention. Xu’s fiancée, rights activist Li Qiaochu, was herself detained in February 2021 on suspicion of “inciting subversion” after posting information about Xu and Ding’s treatment in custody.

Xu Zhiyong, the founder of the New Citizens' Movement -an informal network of activists advocating for governance reforms and denouncing corruption- was previously jailed for 4 years in 2014 on charge of ""gathering a crowd to disturb order in a public place"". 

Except for Xu, at least nine Chinese journalists or press freedom defenders have been arrested for their coverage or comments on handling of Covid-19 pandemic in China, four of which are still detained, including journalist Zhang Zhan, and political commentators Guo Quan, Fang Bin and Ren Zhiqiang.

Xu was sentenced along with civil rights activist Ding Jiaxi, who received 12 years prison term, after a closed-door trial which took place in June 2022. Both have reportedly been deprived of water, food and sleep, and subjected to prolonged interrogations on the ""tiger chair"", a notorious instrument of torture used by the Chinese police, during detention. Xu’s fiancée, rights activist Li Qiaochu, was herself detained in February 2021 on suspicion of “inciting subversion” after posting information about Xu and Ding’s treatment in custody. 

Relentless fight for a free and fair China

Xu Zhiyong, the founder of the New Citizens' Movement -an informal network of activists advocating for governance reforms and denouncing corruption- was previously jailed for 4 years in 2014 on charge of ""gathering a crowd to disturb order in a public place"". 

Except for Xu, at least nine Chinese journalists or press freedom defenders have been arrested for their coverage or comments on handling of Covid-19 pandemic in China, four of which are still detained, including journalist Zhang Zhan, and political commentators Guo Quan, Fang Bin and Ren Zhiqiang. 

China ranks 175th out of 180 in the 2022 RSF World Press Freedom Index and is the world's largest captor of journalists.

54,Thailand,Thailand: 15-year-old WHRD receives death threats,02/05/2023,"Anon Klinkaew, leader of the ultra-royalist group People’s Centre to Protect the Monarchy, has threatened to kill a 15-year-old monarchy reform advocate, because she refused to take part in the judicial process after being charged with royal defamation.

In a 10 April live broadcast on his Facebook page, Anon said he will continue to file charges against critics of the monarchy, including 15-year-old activist Thanalop. He also said he was told that Thanalop and an activist known as “Comrade Sleepless” is the same person, and that he will kill her if this is true.

“Don’t you fucking hope that I’ll stop. I won’t stop no matter what happens,” Anon said. “That fucker Yok or Comrade Sleepless, if they’re the same person, they’re dead. Just wait and see.”

Anon also threatened to beat up Thanalop and kill her if she doesn’t agree to participate in the judicial process. “I will fucking kill you. Don’t tell the police, then,” he said on the broadcast. “I will beat you up, don’t you fucking complain.”

Anon claimed that he was angry because he was mentioned in posts made on Thanalop’s Facebook profile account, which caused him to be attacked by people on social media. He also threatened to file a complaint directly with the court against Thanalop because filing a complaint with the police takes too long.

Anon has previously filed royal defamation complaints against several monarchy reform advocates, including Thanalop, who is now detained at the Ban Pranee Juvenile Vocational Training Centre for Girls.

Thanalop is facing two royal defamation charges, one for an incident that occurred around the Giant Swing in Bangkok’s old town on 13 October 2022 and another for reading a statement condemning the Thai justice system during a protest at the UN headquarters in Bangkok on 18 February 2023. Both complaints were filed against her by Anon.

Thanalop was arrested on Tuesday (28 March) on a warrant issued by the Central Juvenile and Family Court when she went to the Royal Palace Police Station after an activist was arrested for spray-painting graffiti calling for the repeal of the royal defamation law onto the wall of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha within the Grand Palace.

In February 2023, Thanalop, who was 14 years old at the time, received a summons from Samranrat Police Station, after Anon accused her of royal defamation for the 13 October 2022 protest. She asked the police to postpone her appointment to 9 April as she has an examination, but an arrest warrant was issued for her regardless.

Condemning her arrest as unlawful and unfair, Thanalop refused to appoint a lawyer, sign any document, or request bail. When she was taken to court the morning after her arrest, she had to be carried into the courtroom by 7 women officers. The court then ordered her detention.",Right to healthy and safe environment

55,India,"India: HRD beaten, threatened",25/04/2023,"On 9 April 2023, human rights defender Pranab Roy was physically assaulted by officers of the
Border Security Force (BSF) while returning from his agricultural land in North 24 Parganas District
of West Bengal. The officers severely beat the defender, threatened to file false criminal cases
against him and repeatedly said that he was being targetted due to his human rights work. The
following day, 10 April 2023, Pranab Roy filed a complaint against the BSF with the Sutia Police
out post Police recorded his complaint but refused to give him a copy of the First Information
Report (FIR) as required by law. To date no action has been taken against those responsible and
named in the FIR.
Pranab Roy is a human rights defender, activist and farmer in the Barnaberia village of North 24
Parganas District in West Bengal. He is the organiser of Amra Simantabasi (“We, the border
residents”) a community organisation that advocates for socio-political issues faced by people
residing close to the India-Bangladesh border. The human rights defender Pranab Roy has been
vocal for the rights of the local community and against the arbitrary restrictions imposed on them
by the BSF. In 2023, the human rights defender organised a campaign to protest against the illegal
land grabbing of approximately 600 acres of land in North 24 Parganas by the BSF.
On 9 April 2023 around 5 PM, Pranab Roy and his father were stopped by BSF officers from the
105 Batallian posted at the Barnaberia Border outpost and two soldiers while returning from their
agricultural land. The officers asked Pranab Roy a few questions and without warning started
beating and slapping him. They kicked him and hit him with wooden rods and dragged him towards
the river. The officers also threatened Pranab Roy with implicating him under false charges of
smuggling items across the Bangladesh border or of being an undercover agent for Bangladesh.
The BSF officer said that he was punishing Pranab Roy for his human rights work in the village
against the interests of the BSF. The BSF is a paramilitary force posted at the India-Bangladesh
border and is under the direct control of India’s Ministry of Home Affairs. They have been accused
of widespread human rights violations against the local community and reprisals against human
rights defenders.
After severely assaulting Pranab Roy, the BSF officer forced him to sign a false confession stating
that he was detained by the BSF for returning home late at night and was not tortured in any form.
The human rights defender recieved treatment for his injuries at the local hospital and the doctor
who examined him noted “traumatic bruises” on his body.
The following day, on 10 April 2023, Pranab Roy submitted a written complaint at the Sutia Police
outpost against the BSF personnel. While the police accepted the written complaint, they did not
confirm whether a formal complaint has been lodged in the form of a FIR and did not give the
defender a copy of the FIR as required by the Criminal Procedure Code.
Front Line Defenders strongly condemns the violence inflicted on human rights defender Pranab
Roy by BSF personnel as it believes it to be a reprisal against his legitimate and peaceful human
rights work. It is also concerned that the police refused to provide a copy of the FIR, in violation of
the provisions of India’s legal obligations. Front Line Defenders urges the relevant authorities in
India to ensure the safety and security of Pranab Roy and bring the perpetrators to justice in
accordance with international human rights standards.",Right to healthy and safe environment
56,Viet Nam,Vietnam: Another activist arrested in continuous religious repression,20/04/2023,"Authorities in Vietnam’s Central Highlands province of Dak Lak on April 8 arrested former prisoner of conscience Y Krec Buonya and charged him with “Sabotaging implementation of solidarity policies” under Article 116 of the country’s Criminal Code for his religious activities.

According to the state-controlled media, Mr. Y Krec Buonya, 45 years old, is considered the leader of the unregistered religious sect named Central Highlands Evangelical Church of Christ co-established by Pastor Aga who is residing in the US.

The sect is an anti-state group consisting of members of the former Fulro group (United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races) which is said to had worked for an independent state of ethnic minorities in the Central Highlands, said the state media.

Citing information from police, the electronic Dak Lak of the province’s People’s Committee and Party’s Committee, the  Central Highlands Evangelical Church of Christ is working for undermining the people solidarity policy of the state and calling for inciting violence with the goal to establish an autonomous state.

Mr. Y Krec Buonya, who was imprisoned eight years in the past, lives in Knia 2 village, Ea Bar commune, Buon Don district. He was said to receive instruction from Pastor Aga to organize regular training courses in writing human rights violation reports and dealing with police forces. He is also said to be the main factor inciting others.

The news outlet said the province’s police also conducted a house search of his family and confiscated a lot of documentation and important evidence without saying in detail.

After arresting him, he was taken to the provincial Temporary detention center for further investigation, the outlet said. He faces imprisonment of up to 15 years if convicted, according to Vietnam’s law.

Accordingly, the Dak Lak province’s police will arrest other members of the sect in a bid to eliminate it. It is worth noting that authorities in the Central Highlands totally abolished independent Christian sects named Ha Mon and Dega Protestant Churches by 2020.

According to Pastor Aga from North Caroline (US), on April 8, police in Dak Lak also detained eight other members of the sect and released five of them after short interrogation. The remaining three are still under detention but have not been charged.

Since late 2022, authorities in Dak Lak have intensified suppression against the Central Highlands Evangelical Church of Christ, striving not to allow its members to gather for religious meetings, especially on the Christmas celebration. Police detained many members in the different districts for a short time for interrogation and forced them to denounce their religion, blocked them from going out of their residences or confiscated their vehicles.

In late February, a delegation of the US General Consulate in Ho Chi Minh City took a tour in the Central Highlands to meet with Mr. Y Krec Buonya and other members of the sect, however, the delegation was blocked by the local authorities from entering their houses.

Vietnam says the regime respects the right to freedom of religion and belief, however, it requires all religious groups to register with the local authorities.

Dozens of clerks and members of unregistered religious groups in mountainous regions have been imprisoned with lengthy sentences on the allegations of “undermining great solidarity” or “sabotaging implementation of solidarity policies” and “abusing democratic freedom” in the Criminal Code.

The arrest of Y Krec Buonya was made one week prior to the visit of US Secretary Antony Blinken to Hanoi.

On Dec. 2, the U.S. State Department included Vietnam in the group of countries on its Special Watch List for religious freedom. The department said there are not enough violations of religious freedom to label Vietnam a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) which is the highest level of censure for countries that violate religious freedom. However, it said it would monitor the government closely and add it to the CPC if there was no improvement.",Freedom of Religion and Belief

57,Viet Nam,Vietnam: human rights lawyers summoned again as harassment continues (Update),25/04/2023,"Authorities in Vietnam have sent a second summons to at least two lawyers who defended a Buddhist organization in a case last year, asking the lawyers once again to appear for questioning regarding their public discussion of the case.

Dang Dinh Manh is one of five lawyers who defended six members of the Peng Lei Buddhist House, who were found guilty in July 2022 and sentenced to a combined 23 years and six months for incest and fraud, in violation of Article 331 of the country’s criminal code: abusing democratic freedoms.

While providing legal support to Peng Lei Buddhist Church's members, Manh and the other four lawyers, Ngo Thi Hoang Anh, Dao Kim Lan, Nguyen Van Mieng, and Trinh Vinh Phuc used the YouTube account Nhật ký Luật sư (Lawyer's Diary) to post information about the case, making it a common place for their statements. The account no longer has any video content.

The public discussion of the case could also be a violation of Article 331, so authorities in the southern province of Long An issued a summons to the five lawyers on March 6 that required them to report to the police for questioning on March 21. 

Only Trinh Vinh Phuc and Ngo Thi Hoang Anh attended the meeting as requested. So far, neither has disclosed the contents of their meeting.

On Friday, authorities sent a second summons to Manh. According to a copy of the second summons obtained by Radio Free Asia, Manh must report to police on Wednesday. 

At least one of the other lawyers was summoned a second time, one of the lawyers told RFA on condition of anonymity for safety reasons. The unnamed lawyer did not disclose who else had received a second summons. Phuc confirmed that he did not receive a second summons.

RFA attempted to contact the inspector in charge of the case, Hoang Hung, but he did not answer phone calls.

‘Stalinist double-speak’

Article 331 is a violation of international human rights standards, Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at New York-based Human Rights Watch, told RFA’s Vietnamese Service Monday.

“Given how repressive the government has become, it’s not surprising the authorities are using this article to violate yet another right, which is the right to legal representation and a free and fair trial,” Robertson said. “Hanoi deserves global condemnation for going after the few remaining defense lawyers left in the country working on human rights cases, but really what this shows is what a total and absolute joke the Vietnam judiciary has become.”

He said the Vietnamese government is abusing the article for its own aims. 

“The idea that the exercise of ‘democratic freedoms’ should be used to criminalize defense lawyers like Dang Dinh Manh … shows the Stalinist double-speak that the Vietnam government and Communist Party are engaged in,” he said. “This kind of trial shows clearly that justice is dead in Vietnam under the current single-party, rights-repressing government.”

Player and Referee

On Feb. 8, Lan, one of the lawyers, sent a petition to Vietnam’s leaders and several agencies expressing his concerns over the decision to let the Long An provincial police participate in the probe of the case against the lawyers.

Before the first-instance trial for the six Peng Lei members, the lawyers had sent an 11-page report/petition to various agencies to denounce “signs of seriously violating criminal procedures and judicial activities” in the case.

Apart from his concern over the objectivity of the investigation, Lan also said that because he resides and works in Ho Chi Minh City – where he used Facebook and YouTube channels to post information about the Peng Lei case – Ho Chi Minh City’s police should be the authorized agency to investigate whether he had violated Article 331.

One week later, the Vietnam Bar Federation and the Ministry of Public Security responded to Lan’s petition. However, the Ministry of Public Security’s Inspectorate transferred these responses to Long An’s authorities to handle.

On condition of anonymity, one of the five defense lawyers said the fact that central-level agencies’ failure to timely respond to Lan’s petition showed their negligence to the wrongdoings of prosecuting agencies and the necessity to protect citizens’ legitimate interests.  

Another defense lawyer, who also wished to remain anonymous for safety reasons, also raised questions about the objectivity of assigning Long An Provincial Police to handle the case as this would enable the police “to be both a player and the referee.” He said the Supreme People’s Procuracy should be the agency in charge of the case to ensure objectivity.

Ha Huy Son, a lawyer from the Hanoi Bar Association, however, told RFA that the Long An police were assigned the case against the lawyers in accordance with the law.",Right to work
58,Maldives,Maldives: Journalists threatened after reporting on politician and tourism mogul,20/04/2023,"Two senior Maldivian journalists were issued serious threats via phone and text on April 7 following the publication of an article about a high-profile arbitration case between a Maldivian tourism group and Hilton Worldwide. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) joins its affiliate the Maldives Journalists Association (MJA) in strongly condemning the threats against two respected journalists and calls on the Maldivian police for urgent measures to ensure the protection of media workers in the Maldives and the swift apprehension of the perpetrators.

The journalists targeted by the threats were senior journalist and secretary general of IFJ affiliate, the Maldives Journalists Association (MJA), Ahmed Naaif, and the senior editor of news outlet Dhauru, Ahmed Zahir.

The MJA said the men received several intimidatory threats of killing and assault by unknown perpetrators, warning Ahmed Naaif to leave the country ‘within five days’ after the publication of the Dhauru article, titled ‘Siyam and HiltonCase: Red Warning to Investors’, on April 6. The story in question was covering the long-running Singaporean arbitration case between Sun Travel and Tours, which is owned by Maldivian politician Ahmed Siyam Mohamed, and the American hospitality company Hilton Worldwide. Sun Travel and Tours was ordered by the Singapore courts to pay retribution to Hilton, yet also had its own case in the Maldives which served to stall the matter for eight years.

According to the MJA, Siyam, a member of parliament and a leader of the minor coalition party, the Maldives Development Alliance, called Zahiron the evening of April 7 demanding the article be retracted and stated the phone call was his ‘final warning’. The company later issued a statement disparaging the journalists’ coverage and threatened to sue the journalists for defamation. The men subsequently received a series of anonymous death threats.

The MJA said the matter was now with the police and the threats sent to their phones were with investigating officers, but it held grave concerns for the journalists’ safety and the blatant attack on freedom of expression. Siyam’s MDA is in coalition with the current Maldivian government led by President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih.

The IFJ said the threats on the two journalists was a direct assault on all media in the Maldives and presented a poor image of democracy in the Maldives if journalists are not able to go about their work safely and publish in the public interest without fear.

The IFJ said: “Any dispute regarding media reporting in the Maldives should be appropriately handled by the Maldives Media Council, which is the arbiter on such disputes. Despite the position of the person, be they a politician or an everyday Maldivian, this mechanism was established for exactly this purpose. Position or power does not give exemption.”

According to the MJA, the failure of police investigations into past incidents of harassment and intimidation in the Maldives had created a climate of impunity in the country that civil society, media and journalist representative groups and the government had worked hard to tackle through proactive justice measures and a major commission.

In the leadup to the country’s presidential election later this year, both IFJ and MJA have documented a concerning rise in violations against media, prompting stronger calls for concerted action from the government and authorities.

On March 20, the chief editor of the online news outlet Adhadhu, Hussain Fiyaz Moosa, was sent a death threat via text message after he published an article relating to organised crime and religious extremism in the Maldives. But historically, the Maldives sits with a dark history of attacks against journalists after the brutal killings in 2017 and 2014 respectively of journalists and bloggers Yameen Rasheed and Ahmed Rilwan. Both were killed in targeted attacks by extremist groups after receiving a series of death threats that were not adequately investigated or taken seriously.

The MJA said: “Under no circumstances are death threats and threats of physical assault against journalists be taken lightly. This is a more serious issue that needs to be addressed soon. It is the duty of the state to ensure the safety of journalists. We call on the Maldives government and police to provide adequate security to the journalists who were threatened, and we call on law enforcement to investigate the case swiftly and find the perpetrators.”

The IFJ said: “Journalists must be able to conduct their work free from intimidation, harassment, and government interference. The threats against Ahmed Naaif and Ahmed Zahir are a grave concern for all journalists. The media industry is united against threats to reporting and the vital role that journalists play in holding the powerful to account. The Maldivian people must condemn these attacks as an attack to all and the public’s right to know.”",Right to healthy and safe environment
59,Thailand,Thailand: three HRDs arrested,02/05/2023,"25-year-old activist Bang-oen was arrested again yesterday (6 April) on a royal defamation charge filed against him in December 2022, while two other activists were also arrested for spray-painting protest messages onto the Democracy Monument and the Giant Swing.

Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR) reported that Bang-oen was arrested at around 19.50 yesterday (6 April) by 10 officers from the Technology Crime Suppression Division (TCSD) and the Metropolitan Police, led by chief of the Central Investigation Bureau Pol Col Jiraphop Phuridet, while at a gas station in Nonthaburi’s Bang Bua Thong district.

The 25-year-old was taken to the TCSD headquarters. His lawyer then learned that the police was told by an informant seeking monetary reward that Bang-oen would be at the gas station. He was charged with royal defamation and violation of the Computer Crimes Act for a post he made on his Facebook page containing a picture of the royal family on 15 March 2022.

The complaint against him was filed on 2 December 2022 by Anon Klinkaew, head of the ultra-royalist group People’s Centre to Protect the Monarchy, who has filed complaints against several monarchy reform advocates, including 15-year-old Thanalop.

Bang-oen was detained at the TCSD headquarters overnight before being taken to court for a temporary detention request today (7 April). He was later granted bail using a 90,000-baht security covered by the Will of the People bail fund.

Bang-oen, a political artist from Khon Kaen, was previously arrested on 28 March for spray-painting an anarchist symbol and the number 112 with a strike through it, signifying a protest against the royal defamation law, onto the wall of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, located within the Grand Palace. He was charged with damaging a historic site and vandalizing a wall in a public place and detained overnight before being granted bail on a 50,000-baht security.

TLHR noted that Bang-oen has never received a summons before being arrested, and that the arrest warrant was issued 2 days after he was arrested for spray-painting the wall of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. While he was being interrogated, the police presented a warrant from the Criminal Court, issued on 29 March, for access to his mobile phone, claiming that a request was made for technological information to be collected relating to the incident at the Emerald Buddha Temple, but Bang-oen refused to provide any password.

Earlier in 2023, Bang-oen was detained by police officers, who did not present any warrant or inform him of his rights, and taken to Muang Khon Kaen Police Station. TLHR said he was forced to delete pictures of his artwork from his Facebook page and that officers threatened him, saying that his work defames the monarchy and he can be arrested at any time. They also told him not to make art about the monarchy again.

Two other activists were also arrested earlier in the day. Noppasin Treelayapewat, 18, and Sittichai “Oil” (last name withheld) , were arrested at around 6.30 on arrest warrants issued by the Criminal Court for damaging registered historic sites and vandalizing a public place.

TLHR said that they were charged for spray-painting the number 112 with a strike through it onto the base of the Democracy Monument, and the message “Yok was charged with section 112 here,” onto the Giant Swing.

The message spray painted onto the Giant Swing refers to a protest on 13 October 2022, which led to a royal defamation charge against Thanalop, whose nickname is Yok, and her detention.

TLHR said that the two activists were initially taken to Samranrat Police Station, which is responsible for the charges against them, but were later separated. Noppasin was taken to Chalongkrung Police Station, while Sittichai was taken to Thung Song Hong Police Station. The police did not say why the two activists were being separated, while TLHR reported that Noppasin was initially handcuffed.

Officers from Phaya Thai, Dusit, and Din Daeng Police Stations also came to inform them of other charges while they were detained. They were charged with destruction of property and vandalising a public place for spray-painting protest symbols at several locations in central Bangkok.

Noppasin and Sittichai were detained overnight at Chalongkrung and Thung Song Hong police stations, respectively. They were taken to court today (7 April) for a temporary detention request, and were released after the court dismissed the detention request.",Right to Protest

Two other activists were also arrested earlier in the day. Noppasin Treelayapewat, 18, and Sittichai “Oil” (last name withheld) , were arrested at around 6.30 on arrest warrants issued by the Criminal Court for damaging registered historic sites and vandalizing a public place.

TLHR said that they were charged for spray-painting the number 112 with a strike through it onto the base of the Democracy Monument, and the message “Yok was charged with section 112 here,” onto the Giant Swing.

The message spray painted onto the Giant Swing refers to a protest on 13 October 2022, which led to a royal defamation charge against Thanalop, whose nickname is Yok, and her detention.

TLHR said that the two activists were initially taken to Samranrat Police Station, which is responsible for the charges against them, but were later separated. Noppasin was taken to Chalongkrung Police Station, while Sittichai was taken to Thung Song Hong Police Station. The police did not say why the two activists were being separated, while TLHR reported that Noppasin was initially handcuffed.

59,Thailand,Thailand: three HRDs arrested,02/05/2023,"25-year-old activist Bang-oen was arrested again yesterday (6 April) on a royal defamation charge filed against him in December 2022, while two other activists were also arrested for spray-painting protest messages onto the Democracy Monument and the Giant Swing.

Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR) reported that Bang-oen was arrested at around 19.50 yesterday (6 April) by 10 officers from the Technology Crime Suppression Division (TCSD) and the Metropolitan Police, led by chief of the Central Investigation Bureau Pol Col Jiraphop Phuridet, while at a gas station in Nonthaburi’s Bang Bua Thong district.

The 25-year-old was taken to the TCSD headquarters. His lawyer then learned that the police was told by an informant seeking monetary reward that Bang-oen would be at the gas station. He was charged with royal defamation and violation of the Computer Crimes Act for a post he made on his Facebook page containing a picture of the royal family on 15 March 2022.

The complaint against him was filed on 2 December 2022 by Anon Klinkaew, head of the ultra-royalist group People’s Centre to Protect the Monarchy, who has filed complaints against several monarchy reform advocates, including 15-year-old Thanalop.

Bang-oen was detained at the TCSD headquarters overnight before being taken to court for a temporary detention request today (7 April). He was later granted bail using a 90,000-baht security covered by the Will of the People bail fund.

Bang-oen, a political artist from Khon Kaen, was previously arrested on 28 March for spray-painting an anarchist symbol and the number 112 with a strike through it, signifying a protest against the royal defamation law, onto the wall of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, located within the Grand Palace. He was charged with damaging a historic site and vandalizing a wall in a public place and detained overnight before being granted bail on a 50,000-baht security.

TLHR noted that Bang-oen has never received a summons before being arrested, and that the arrest warrant was issued 2 days after he was arrested for spray-painting the wall of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. While he was being interrogated, the police presented a warrant from the Criminal Court, issued on 29 March, for access to his mobile phone, claiming that a request was made for technological information to be collected relating to the incident at the Emerald Buddha Temple, but Bang-oen refused to provide any password.

Earlier in 2023, Bang-oen was detained by police officers, who did not present any warrant or inform him of his rights, and taken to Muang Khon Kaen Police Station. TLHR said he was forced to delete pictures of his artwork from his Facebook page and that officers threatened him, saying that his work defames the monarchy and he can be arrested at any time. They also told him not to make art about the monarchy again.

60,Afghanistan,Afghanistan: academic arrested for criticising the Taliban,01/05/2023,"

Local sources in Badakhshan province report that Taliban intelligence agency has arrested a university professor in this province.

Sources on Tuesday, April 5, said that the professor’s name is Sakhi-Dad Sangin and he is the English Language and Literature department professor at Badakhshan University.

Sources add that Taliban arrested him last week on charges of criticizing Taliban educational policies towards girls and the closure of girls’ schools in front of the gates of Badakhshan University as he was leaving the campus.

Meanwhile, another source says that Taliban has arrested him on charges of moral corruption.

This comes as Taliban have imprisoned their critics on similar charges in various provinces.

It is said that the students and faculty of Badakhshan University have not said anything about the arrest of this professor out of fear of Taliban.

Sources say that Sangin had been teaching at Badakhshan University as a professor for the past 10 years, and students have had no complaints about him.

Taliban have not commented on the arrest of this university professor.

Taliban have previously arrested and suppressed a large number of their critics.

In the latest case, they also arrested Mateullah Visa, the head of the Pen Path Foundation.

62,Myanmar,Myanmar: pro-democracy leader sentenced to additional 34 year of jail (Update),02/05/2023,"A prison court in Sagaing region’s Monywa township has sentenced student activist and anti-regime strike leader Wai Moe Naing to 34 years in prison.

He has already been sentenced to 12 years in prison but will probably only have to serve the longest of all the terms, meaning he will spend 20 years behind bars, Monywa University of Economics Student Union President Shin Thant told RFA. 

“Wai Moe Naing is in good health and passes the time with a strong spirit,” Shin Thant said. 

“He gave a message for his comrades outside to be patient and strong.”

Wednesday’s judgment included a 20 year sentence for robbery, three years for rioting, one year for carrying a deadly weapon in a crowd, one year for inflicting pain on another, and three years for incitement to mutiny under Section 505 (a) of the Penal Code, broadened after the Feb. 2021 coup from only military personnel to include all civil servants.

Wai Moe Naing could face an even longer sentence if two more cases, both carrying maximum 20 year terms, are not served concurrently. He is yet to be tried for the alleged killing of two policemen and sedition, according to his college's student leaders.

After the military seized power just over two years ago, Wai Moe Naing led anti-regime strikes in Monywa.

On April 15, 2021, he was riding in a column of motorcycles with other protesting students when junta troops and police ran him down in cars and arrested him.

63,Bangladesh,Bangladesh: Journalist attacked and thrown off building for reporting illegal land clearances,20/04/2023,"Bangladeshi journalist Ayub Meahzi has suffered grave injuries after a group of unidentified armed assailants attacked and threw him from a two-story building in Chittagong on April 4. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) condemns the brutal attack and calls on authorities to conduct an immediate and transparent inquiry into the incident.

On April 4, a group of approximately ten men armed with machetes, iron rods, and sticks stormed the second floor of a building to attack Meahzi, a Chandanaish based correspondent for Janobani and The Daily Shangu. The men then threw the journalist from the building onto the street, where he sustained significant injuries.

The Daily Starreported that Meahzi broke three ribs and suffered injuries to his head from the fall. He was admitted to Chattogram Medical College Hospital in a critical state and is now recovering.

According to the journalist’s family, Meahzi was attacked for reporting on illegal land clearances in the East Dohazari area, informing local authorities of the issue in the process. Chandnaish police claim to have arrested one person identified from video footage of the attack, while two of the accused have absconded.

A protest condemning Meahzi’s assault was held on April 5 at Dohajari Sadar, where members of Patia Press Club and Chandanaish Press Club addressed the crowd. Journalists, press clubs, and journalist representative organisations condemned the violence, called for an investigation into the incident, and promised further action if arrests failed to materialise.

Journalists and media workers inBangladesh continue to face significant threats of torture, harassment, and intimidation while in the field. On April 18, two journalists were assaulted in  Narayanganj while gathering information at a local hospital, after recording a fight that broke out between patients. According to Amnesty International, 56 journalists in Bangladesh have been tortured, harassed, sued, intimidated, and prevented from doing their jobs in the first three months of this year.

The IFJ said: “The attack against Ayub Meahzi represents the significant danger posed to journalists working in Bangladesh. This incident is nothing short of an attempted murder and should be investigated as such. The IFJ condemns the attack and urges the Bangladeshi authorities to conduct an immediate and transparent investigation.”",Right to healthy and safe environment
64,China,China: veteran defender stands trial during detention,03/05/2023,"A former student leader of the 1989 protest movement at Hangzhou University has stood trial in the eastern province of Zhejiang for “picking quarrels and stirring up trouble,” a charge frequently used to target peaceful critics of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, after he refused food and drink in detention to commemorate the Tiananmen massacre.

Xu Guang appeared in poor health and was extremely weak as he stood trial by video link at the Xihu District People’s Court on April 3, following months of hunger striking and intermittent force-feeding while in a police-run detention center, fellow activist Li Qing told Radio Free Asia on Wednesday.

He told the court that he had refused food and drink in detention to remind the world to “never forget June 4th,” the date of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre that put an end to weeks of student-led protest in Beijing and other major Chinese cities.

“He was very weak,” Li said. “It wasn’t that cold ... but he was wearing a padded jacket, so I think he must be pretty thin – his face looked very thin.”

Li said the authorities had removed his nutritional IV drip, and that Xu had asked for it to be brought back before he would address the court.

“I need the nutrient drip if I’m to have the strength to speak,” Xu said, after which his doctor told the judge that he should be able to speak with no problem.

“I can’t talk with the nutrient drip,” Xu insisted, speaking slowly but clearly after it was wheeled over and put in again, according to Li.

Later, he told the court: “I had just one aim in pursuing this hunger strike, which was to remind the world not to forget June 4th.”

Public mourning for victims or discussion of the events of spring and summer 1989 are banned, and references to June 4, 1989, blocked, filtered or deleted by the Great Firewall of government internet censorship.

Tank-shaped ice cream

Beauty influencer Austin Li, part of a generation of younger Chinese people who consequently know little of the massacre, had his June 3, 2022, livestream interrupted after he displayed a tank-shaped ice cream dessert, prompting censors to pull the plug immediately.

Li said he was particularly moved by Xu’s closing statement.

“He said: ‘I love this country, and I love the Chinese people. I want the verdict on the 1989 protests to be overturned,’” Li said.

Xu friend and fellow activist Zou Wei said the prosecution had based its case on comments made by Xu on overseas social media platforms.

“The long arm of the Chinese Communist Party now extends overseas,” Zou said. “Xu Guang’s video comments on Facebook, Twitter and Telegram are being used as a basis for conviction.”

The prosecution requested a jail term of less than five years, sources told Radio Free Asia.

Xu, 54, had been approached by officers from the Xihu district police department and warned to keep a low profile during the 33rd anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre on June 4, 2022.

He was later detained after he held up a placard outside his local police station calling for the official verdict on the 1989 protest movement to be overturned.

‘Never publicly accounted for its actions’

Xu previously served a five-year jail term after trying to formally register the China Democracy Party as a political party in 1998, and has repeatedly called on the party leadership to overturn the official verdict of “counterrevolutionary rebellion” on the 1989 protests.

The New York-based Human Rights in China describes the June 3-4, 1989, massacre as a government-backed military crackdown that ended large-scale, peaceful protests in Beijing and other cities during that year.

But the government described the protests as “counterrevolutionary riots,” a term they later replaced with “political disturbances” which they say were suppressed by “decisive measures.”

“The Chinese government has never publicly accounted for its actions with an independent and open investigation, brought to justice those responsible for the killing of unarmed civilians, or compensated the survivors or families of those killed,” the group says on its website.

“In fact, it has never made public even the names and the number of people killed or wounded during the crackdown, or of those executed or imprisoned afterwards in connection with the protests,” it said.",Right to Protest
65,Sri Lanka,Sri Lanka: media worker summoned for interrogation,01/05/2023,"On 1 April 2023, journalist and human rights defender Ramachandran Sanath was summoned to
appear before the Terrorism Investigation Department (TID) office in Nuwareliya (Central Province)
for an inquiry on 6 April 2023. The summons was delivered to Ramachandran Sanath’s home in
Kandy. The TID refused to disclose the purpose of the inquiry. Front Line Defenders is concerned
about the harassment of Ramachandran Sanath, and believe this treatment is linked to his human
rights and journalism work.
Ramachandran Sanath is an independent Tamil journalist, human rights defender, and advocate
for the rights of plantation workers in Kandy, Sri Lanka. He held the position of executive treasurer
and currently serves as an executive member of the Sri Lanka Working Journalist Association. He
has previously worked for the Tamil-language daily print newspaper ""Sudaroli"", and the news web-
site ""Malayaga Kuruvi”. Ramachandran Sanath presently works as a parliament correspondent for
Uthayan, and serves as an international correspondent for Ethiroli, an Australian Tamil news web-
site. He is known for his outspoken criticism of government policies. Apart from his work as a jour-
nalist, Ramachandran Sanath actively writes about social issues and the human rights issues per-
taining to Indian-origin Tamils in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, he has been actively involved in protest-
ing and advocating for land rights and fair wages for plantation workers.
The summoning of Ramachandran Sanath by the TID has raised serious concerns regarding his
safety and security, as the Sri Lankan anti-terror law and its associated mechanisms have histori-
cally been employed against Tamils and Muslims. There are frequent reports of harassment di-
rected towards human rights defenders, peaceful protesters, and journalists, indicative of reprisals
for their efforts to promote human rights and expose abuses.
The Indian-origin Tamils, also known as Malayaga Tamils, were brought to Sri Lanka in the 1800s
by the British to work on plantations. They have faced continuous human rights violations, notably
the stripping of citizenship rights in 1948, and the denial of land ownership after the Regional Plan -
tation Companies took over in 1992. Issues of low pay, increased workloads, and demands for
land rights have sparked protests and strikes. These struggles have been consistently and vehe-
mently opposed, and the wage increase proposals and solutions are often unfair and fragmented.
Moreover, those advocating for fair wages and land rights for the Malayaga Tamils have frequently
been subjected to persecution by both the state and plantation companies.
Ramachandran Sanath has been targeted, harassed, and been subject to surveillance due to his
journalism in advocacy for fair wages and land rights of Malayaga plantation workers in Sri Lanka.
After participating in a wage rights protest in February 2021, he was subjected to harassment and
surveillance. In March and May 2021, unidentified individuals claiming to be intelligence officers
visited his family's homes inquiring about his whereabouts and activities. The human rights de-
fender wrote to the Inspector General of Police on 25 May 2021, in response to the intimidation,
but no action has been taken thus far.
Front Line Defenders is deeply troubled by the acts of reprisals against Ramachandran Sanath, as
well as other human rights activists and journalists, particularly those from Tamil and Muslim com-
munities. It is imperative that all individuals, especially journalists and human rights defenders, are able to engage in peaceful protests and legitimate dissent without fear of reprisals from the Sri
Lankan government or other structures.",Right to healthy and safe environment

“The 24-year-old man was sentenced on April 1,” an Indaw resident told RFA, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Three other women were also sentenced [on April 3]. All received life time imprisonment under Sections 50 (j) and 52(a)”, a local man told RFA.

Section 50 (j) of the Counter-Terrorism Law relates to funding terrorism, while 52 (a) covers the organization of or participation in terrorist acts along with harboring terrorists or hosting meetings.

The four were among 22 people arrested and accused of donating money to the Indaw People’s Defense Force. The other 18 were released on bail.

“A PDF member was arrested first. Then [more] people were arrested and accused of having their names on the donor list [to the PDF]. But there is no evidence,” said a woman who also declined to be named for fear of reprisals. 

“The arrest of the teacher Thein Hla also has no evidence. She was accused of providing 100,000 to 200,000 [kyat or U.S.$48-96] in that list and was arrested. She has committed no serious crime.

67,China,China: human rights lawyer sentenced to 5-year imprisonment (Update),01/05/2023,"

On 31 March 2023, the Nanning Municipal Intermediate Court in Guangxi province convicted human rights lawyer Qin Yongpei of “inciting subversion to State power” and sentenced him to five years in prison, to be followed by three years of “deprivation of political rights”. The human rights defender said he would appeal.

According to the verdict, the court’s decision was based on the human rights defender’s online speech on Twitter and on the Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo criticising government wrongdoing and corruption, the interviews he gave to overseas media outlets, and his role in establishing a support group for disbarred human rights lawyers. The court said these acts amount to disinformation and libel against the government, the judiciary, and the Chinese Communist Party, and thus constitute “incitement to subversion of State power” under article 105(2) of the Criminal Law.

The human rights defender has been in detention since late October 2019 and was tried on 31 December 2021. In September 2022, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention ruled that Qin Yongpei’s detention is arbitrary because his fair trial rights were not guaranteed and that the charge of “inciting subversion of State power” is so ill-defined that it fails to meet the principle of legal certainty. The Working Group also ruled that the human rights defender’s arrest and detention were in retaliation against his exercise of his human rights, including the rights to defend human rights, freedom of expression, and freedom of association. The Working Group called for his release and for the Chinese government to amend its Criminal Law, including article 105, to align it with China’s human rights obligations under international law.

Front Line Defenders strongly condemns today’s verdict against Qin Yongpei as it believes it is solely in retaliation against his peaceful and legitimate human rights work. We call on the relevant authorities in China to promptly quash the conviction and sentence against Qin Yongpei and immediately release him.

The Working Group also ruled that the human rights defender’s arrest and detention were in retaliation against his exercise of his human rights, including the rights to defend human rights, freedom of expression, and freedom of association. The Working Group called for his release and for the Chinese government to amend its Criminal Law, including article 105, to align it with China’s human rights obligations under international law.

Front Line Defenders strongly condemns today’s verdict against Qin Yongpei as it believes it is solely in retaliation against his peaceful and legitimate human rights work. We call on the relevant authorities in China to promptly quash the conviction and sentence against Qin Yongpei and immediately release him.

69,Afghanistan,Afghanistan: women-run radio broadcaster shut down,02/05/2023,"On Thursday, March 30, authorities in the city of Faizabad, in Badakhshan province, shuttered the broadcaster’s operations and sealed its office, according to news reports and an employee of the radio station who spoke to CPJ on the condition of anonymity, citing fear of reprisal.

The officers at the scene, from the Taliban’s Directorate of Information and Culture and Directorate of Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, accused the outlet of illegally airing music during the holy month of Ramadan. The Taliban banned playing and listening to music when it retook power in August 2021.

The radio station employee who spoke to CPJ said she was not aware that any music had been aired, and believed that the decision was retaliation for the station’s programs focusing on women’s education and job opportunities in Badakhshan.

“The Taliban should immediately reverse its decision shuttering the Radio Sada e Banowan broadcaster and allow the outlet to reopen and work freely,” said CPJ Asia Program Coordinator Beh Lih Yi. “The Taliban have deprived Afghan women of everything from jobs to education. Shutting down a women-run radio station shows there is no reprieve for the Afghan media even during the holy month of Ramadan. The Taliban must correct its course and stop cracking down on journalism.”

Radio Sada e Banowan was established in 2014 and owned by Afghan female journalist Najla Shirzad. Local Taliban officials allowed the radio station to restart operations not long after the group retook power. It has six employees, according to the person who spoke to CPJ.

CPJ contacted Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid for comment via messaging app but did not receive any response.

In August 2022, CPJ published a special report about the media crisis in Afghanistan, showing a rapid deterioration in press freedom since the Taliban retook control of the country one year earlier, marked by censorship, arrests, assaults, and restrictions on women journalists.",Media freedom

70,Viet Nam,Vietnam: detained couple had sentence upheld in appeal (Update),24/04/2023,"A Vietnamese man who livestreamed YouTube videos deemed critical of the government and leaders and his spouse lost their appeals trial on Wednesday for prison sentences they received for “abusing democratic freedoms.”

In November 2022, a court in Dong Nai province sentenced Nguyen Thai Hung, 50, to a four-year term and his wife, Vu Thi Kim Hoang, 45, to two-and-a-half years for running the “Telling the Truth TV” YouTube channel. 

It had nearly 40,000 followers and earned allegedly “illegal profits” of more than 384 million dong, or U.S.$15,500, from advertisements. 

Dong Nai police arrested the couple in January 2022, though they released Hoang in late April. 

Authorities said Hung livestreamed 21 videos on his YouTube channel from June 2020 until his arrest, during which he spoke badly of the Communist Party of Vietnam and the state, distorted socioeconomic development policies and slandered senior party and government leaders. 

At their earlier trial, in Tan Phu District, police presented evidence from material they said that the pair broadcast on the social media platform addressing a deadly January 2020 police raid over a land dispute in northern Vietnam’s Dong Tam village. 

The couple also broadcast content regarding the management of prisoners and Vietnam’s communist regime and the legal system.

The videos, which generated 19,000-56,000 views each, are no longer available for viewing on YouTube. 

The communist country tightly curbs freedom of expression and enforces stringent controls over online content.

Though the couple did not have legal representation at the first trial, for the appeals trial, Hung was represented by attorney Nguyen Van Mieng, and Hoang by attorney Ngo Thi Hoang Anh. 

'Unfair' outcome

Speaking to Radio Free Asia after the trial, Hoang, who maintains that she had no part in the making or production of the videos, said the outcome was unfair.

“Mr. Hung only exercised his freedom of speech and wanted to make society better, not to oppose or ruin the state,” she said. “The defense attorney had great arguments, stressing that Vietnam has signed international conventions on human rights.” 

Hoang also complained about the upholding of her own sentence on the basis that she supported Hung by taking care of him, providing him with accommodations and letting him use her laptop computer and bank account. 

Hoang’s elder sister, Vu Giang Tien, who had attended the trial, told RFA that attorney Nguyen Van Mieng’s arguments were strong.  

“He said there was not enough evidence to convict [Hung] and that Article 25 of the Constitution states that we [citizens] have freedom of speech following international conventions,” Tien said. 

“Despite whatever the lawyer said, the judging panel still had their own way and made their own decision.”  

After the trial ended, authorities took Hung back to Dong Nai police’s detention facility and allowed Hoang to return home to wait for the court’s decision on judgment implementation.",Right to liberty and security

If convicted, he faces up to seven years in prison. His whereabouts were unknown for about 10 hours, after which the police stated that he was in custody and is being charged under Bangladesh’s draconian Digital Security Act.

72,Viet Nam,Vietnam: WHRD harassed after being released,01/05/2023,"Vietnamese police have been harassing a former prisoner of conscience released from jail in December 2022 after serving most of a five-year sentence on charges of distributing materials against the state and participating in protests against the government.

Nguyen Thi Ngoc Suong, 55, told Radio Free Asia on Friday, that the harassment began after she attended the appeals trial of activists Nguyen Thai Hung and his spouse, Vu Thi Kim Hoang, at the People’s Court in the southern province of Dong Nai on March 29. Authorities asked her to leave the courtroom.

On Friday, Dinh Quan district police summoned her and warned her not to attend other trials. They also said policemen would check on her often. 

“Recently, the police have watched me very closely,” Suong told Radio Free Asia after she met with police. “They came to see me right after I returned home [from the trial]. They said I was not allowed to do this.” 

At the end of the meeting, a police officer told her: “I’ll visit you every couple of days.” 

Suong said she did not remember the officer’s name because he was not wearing a name badge. 

When RFA contacted Dinh Quan district police to verify the information, a staffer asked for the name of the officer for verification. 

Suong, who said her health has been deteriorating since her release, was convicted in May 2019 under Article 117 of Vietnam’s penal code. The article, which criminalizes “making, storing, distributing or disseminating information, documents and items” against the state. Violators can be sentenced to from five to 20 years in prison.  

Suong was freed last Dec. 13 in poor health, 10 months before her jail term ended. 

Health issues while detained 

While in prison, Suong had several physical ailments, including liver and kidney swelling, elevated liver enzymes, a bacterial infection in her stomach and thyroid issues.   

The only treatment she received was the medicine that prison officials gave to all inmates to treat various diseases.  

“When I took them, my condition got worse,” Suong said. “I remember one time I could not speak because my body was swollen from top to toe, including my mouth and tongue.” 

Suong said she believes her health deteriorated because she had been subjected to forced labor at Dong Nai police’s B5 temporary detention facility where she was held during the investigation period, and later at An Phuoc Prison, where she was held after an appeals trial. She produced votive paper offerings without protective gear.  

Suong also said she had not been paid for her labor, though Vietnamese law stipulates that inmates should receive some compensation for labor they perform in jail.  

While she was at the temporary detention facility from October 2018 to early December 2019, Suong's family had to bribe staffers so they could get supplies to her, though she never received them after the payments were made, she said.  

When Suong had a medical check after she was released, her doctor said she was very weak and it would be difficult for her to improve her physical condition because she took too much pain reliever in previous years.  

RFA could not reach officials at Dong Nai police or An Phuoc Prison for comment. 

Arrested and charged in 2018 

Suong was arrested along with activist Vu Thi Dung in October 2018, and they were both brought to court in the same case for using different Facebook accounts to watch videos and read articles containing anti-state content. 

They both allegedly called for protests against draft laws on the creation of new special economic zones and cybersecurity, and were said to have incited locals people to take to the streets.  

The indictment also said that Dung had produced anti-state leaflets and asked Suong to distribute them at four different places in Dinh Quan town of Dong Nai province. 

Dung was sentenced to six years in prison and will complete her jail term this month.  

Suong received the Tran Van Ba Award for 2021-2022 along with four other Vietnamese activists — Nguyen Thuy Hanh, Huynh Thuc Vy, Vo An Don and Nguyen Thi Ngoc Hanh. 

Named for a Vietnamese dissident and freedom fighter executed in 1985 on charges of treason and intent to overthrow the government, the award is given annually to Vietnamese in Vietnam in recognition of their courageous action for freedom, democracy, justice and independence for their country.",Freedom of movement

73,Myanmar,Myanmar: 13 youth sentenced on incitement charges,03/05/2023,"A junta court has sentenced 13 youth activists to three years of hard labor in prison each for “incitement” after they organized a flash protest against military rule that authorities broke up by plowing into them with vehicles.

They were among nearly 30 activists accused of organizing the Sept. 13, 2022, flash protest – organized over social media to keep authorities in the dark – in Yangon’s Kyimyindaing township.

To quell the protest, junta security personnel drove two taxis and three other civilian cars into the crowd, injuring several people.

The court in Yangon’s Insein Prison issued the sentences in a closed hearing on March 29 for “spreading rumors or reports with the intent to cause fear or alarm among the public to commit offenses against the state” under Section 505(a) of Myanmar’s Penal Code, the defendants’ lawyers and sources close to their families told RFA Burmese.

“These young activists were those arrested during the anti-junta protest on Pan Pin Gyi Street [in Yangon] in September 2022,” one of the lawyers said, speaking on condition of anonymity citing fear of reprisal.

The lawyer said that the 13 youths who were sentenced last week are “just old enough” to be prosecuted under Section 505(a). They ranged in age from 18 to 25.

“Some of [the arrested activists] are minors and they were tried [separately] in juvenile courts,” the lawyer said.

The activists belong to various groups that have protested the military’s Feb. 1, 2021, coup d’etat including the Octopus youth organization, Basic Education Students & Youths Association, Myanmar Labour Alliance, Bama Youth Network, Pyin Nyar Nan Daw Private School Student's Union, Owl Community, and Confederation of Trade Unions Myanmar.

It was not immediately clear whether those sentenced intend to appeal.

Those arrested in poor health

A member of the Myanmar Labour Alliance – whose members Nay Min Tun, Than Zaw, Zu Zu Yar Khaing, Ya Min Kay Thwal Khaing and Aye Chan Aung were among those sentenced – told RFA that all 13 are “in poor health” after being violently arrested and interrogated.

“We know that they had asked for medication as they could not sleep at night due to the pain from those injuries,” the alliance member said.

Among those sentenced were journalists Myat Ko Oo, Pyae Phyo Thu and San Lin Phyo, said lawyers.
Yay Ba Wal, the president of Octopus, said five members of his organization were in the group of 13, including two women, two men, and one non-binary member of the LGBTQ community.

“The five Octopus members who have been arrested and imprisoned have only been able to see their families when they were taken out [of Insein Prison] for a court hearing,” he said.

“Arbitrary and unjust punishments for young people who protest peacefully have already become a routine practice of the terrorist junta.”

Sending a message

Jewel, a member of the anti-junta Pazundaung Botahtaung Youth Strike Committee, told RFA that the forceful arrest and maximum punishment of the youth protesters was meant to send a message to the international community that Myanmar is “stable” under military rule.

“When there was a protest, news spread through the internet and social media networks, reaching the international community,” she said. “That’s why every time there is a protest, the junta fails in its attempt to convince the international community that it is ruling the country in a stable state.”

“That’s why I think they have suppressed the youth protesters so aggressively like this,” she added.

Jewel noted that protests of military rule have not stopped, despite the junta using every means at its disposal to arrest participants.

September’s crackdown was not the first time junta security personnel had driven vehicles into a crowd of protesters on Pan Pin Gyi Street.

On Dec. 5, 2021, authorities driving a military vehicle rammed into a group of youths protesting the coup on Pan Pin Gyi Street, seriously injuring two journalists, before arresting participants.

76,Thailand,Thailand: 15-year-old WHRD arrested on royal defamation charges,01/05/2023,"Thai authorities should immediately drop charges and release a 15-year-old student activist detained for allegedly defaming the monarchy, Human Rights Watch said today.

On March 28, 2023, the police arrested Thanalop “Yok” Phalanchai in Bangkok and accused her of committing lèse-majesté (insulting the monarchy) offenses for criticizing the monarchy during a rally in October 2022 in front of the Bangkok City Hall. At the rally, protesters called for the release of political detainees and for the abolition of royal defamation prosecutions. Thanalop is being held in pretrial detention at the Justice Ministry’s Ban Pranee Juvenile Vocational Training Center for Girls in Nakhon Pathom province, west of Bangkok, for allegedly violating article 112 of Thailand’s criminal code, which is punishable by up to 15 years in prison.

“Thai authorities should immediately release Thanalop and drop the unjust case against her for criticizing the monarchy,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “By arresting a 15-year-old girl, the Thai government is sending the spine-chilling message that even children aren’t safe from being harshly punished for expressing their opinions.”

The number of lèse-majesté cases in Thailand has significantly increased in the past year, Human Rights Watch said. After almost a three-year hiatus in which lèse-majesté cases were not brought before the courts, in November 2020 Prime Minister Gen. Prayut Chan-ocha ordered the authorities to restore lèse-majesté prosecutions, ostensibly because of growing criticisms of the monarchy. Since then, the authorities have charged more than 200 people with lèse-majesté crimes, primarily for actions at pro-democracy rallies or comments on social media.

Human Rights Watch and several United Nations human rights monitoring bodies, including the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, have repeatedly voiced concern over the Thai government’s use of arbitrary arrest and pretrial detention to punish critics of the monarchy for their views.

Holding those charged with lèse-majesté in pretrial detention violates their rights under international human rights law. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which Thailand has ratified, encourages bail for criminal suspects. Article 9 states that, “It shall not be the general rule that persons awaiting trial shall be detained in custody, but release may be subject to guarantees to appear for trial.” Those whose charges have not been dropped should be tried without undue delay, Human Rights Watch said.

The Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by Thailand, states that the arrest, detention, or imprisonment of a child “shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time.”

Lèse-majesté prosecutions also raise serious freedom of expression concerns under the ICCPR. General Comment 34 of the UN Human Rights Committee, the international expert body that monitors compliance with the covenant, states that laws such as those for lèse-majesté “should not provide for more severe penalties solely on the basis of the identity of the person that may have been impugned” and that governments “should not prohibit criticism of institutions.”

“The Thai government should permit peaceful expression of political views, including questions about the monarchy,” Pearson said. “Thai authorities should engage with UN experts and others about amending the lèse-majesté law to bring it into compliance with international human rights standards.”",Freedom of assembly

79,Viet Nam,Vietnam: Land rights activist sentenced to 6-years imprisonment under repressive law (Update),30/03/2023,"A land rights activist accused of giving interviews to foreign media and storing illegally printed books was sentenced to six years in prison for “conducting anti-state propaganda.” 

Only Truong Van Dung’s wife was allowed to attend the half-day trial as a witness. Many activists in Hanoi told Radio Free Asia that they had been forced to stay at home or were prevented from getting near the court.

According to his indictment, Dung gave interviews to U.S.-based Saigon Dallas Radio between 2015 and 2022 that distorted and smeared Vietnam’s government, propagated fabricated information and caused confusion among the people. The interviews and video clips were posted on social media.  

The Hanoi People’s Procuracy also accused Dung of storing copies of two books: “Popular Politics” by human rights activist Pham Doan Trang and “Life of People Behind Bars” by former prisoner of conscience Pham Thanh Nghien. The books were allegedly printed and distributed illegally. 

Dung, 65, was convicted under Article 88 of Vietnam’s 1999 penal code, a controversial law used to target dissidents that rights groups say is one of several wielded to stifle voices of dissent in the one-party communist state. 

‘Latest in a long line’
His wife, Nghiem Thi Hop, told RFA that defense lawyers argued that he did not conduct the interviews as alleged in the indictment. But prosecutors said the Hanoi Department of Information and Communications concluded that it was Dung who spoke to the program.

She said police used physical violence against Dung during interrogations. 

Dung has participated in protests in Hanoi, including demonstrations against China’s occupation of the Paracel Islands — an island group in the South China Sea also claimed by Vietnam — and protests against the Taiwan-owned Formosa Company for polluting the coastline of four central Vietnamese provinces of Vietnam in 2016.

Public protests even over perceived harm to Vietnam’s interests are considered threats to its political stability and are routinely suppressed by the police.

Before the trial, Human Rights Watch called on Vietnam to drop all charges against Dung. The organization’s deputy Asia director, Phil Robertson, said in a statement on Monday that Dung was “the latest in a long line of human rights defenders silenced by the Vietnamese government for protesting against human rights violations and advocating for reforms.” 

At least 11 activists have been detained for investigation on Article 88 charges while they await a scheduled date for their trial.

Sentence in case tied to U.S.-based organization-
In a separate case, an appeals court in Ho Chi Minh City upheld sentences for two people accused of being members of the Provisional Government of Vietnam – a U.S.-based opposition group described by Vietnamese authorities as a terrorist organization.

Nguyen Van Nghia, 48, and Duong Thi Be, 41, were sentenced to seven years and five years in prison, respectively, according to the online edition of the People’s Newspaper. 

Both were charged with “carrying out activities to overthrow the people’s government” under Article 109 of Vietnam’s 2015 Penal Code. They were first sentenced in October by Kien Giang province’s court.

Based in Orange County, California, the Provisional Government of Vietnam was founded in 1991 by former soldiers and refugees loyal to the U.S.-backed government of South Vietnam that was overthrown and absorbed by North Vietnam in 1975. The group now refers to itself as the Third Republic of Vietnam, according to its website.

According to the indictment, Nghia visited the homepage of the Provisional Government of Vietnam in 2014. He also participated in a “referendum” in 2018 to elect Vietnamese-American citizen Dao Minh Quan, who leads the organization, as president of the Third Republic of Vietnam.

More than 60 arrests since 2017-
Nghia was also said to have recruited many people to join the organization, and at the end of October 2021, he registered Be, his girlfriend, to be a member of the organization. He also allegedly called on government and military officers in Vietnam to join the organization. 

Later in 2021, he was assigned to be the official spokesman for the organization in Vietnam.

According to RFA statistics, at least 60 people in Vietnam have been convicted for being members of Dao Minh Quan’s organization since 2017. They were all charged with “carrying out activities against the state,” and many were accused of committing violent and terrorist acts, including making petrol bombs and burning airport garages.

However, some people, including Tran Van Luong, who was sentenced to five years in 2017 and released last year, have told RFA that they were not a member of the organization.

According to Luong, police arrested him only because he had been dissatisfied with the Vietnamese government and had voiced his criticism on Facebook. Then they forced him to make statements that he had contacted Dao Minh Quan’s organization.

80,Kazakhstan,Kazakhstan: three detained for demonstration,01/05/2023,"Police detained three Kazakh activists in Almaty on March 27 after they demonstrated near the Chinese consulate to demand the release of their relatives from China’s Xinjiang Province.

Activists Akikat Kaliolla, Nurzat Yermekbay, and Zauatkhan Tursyn were taken to the police department of the Medeu district, according to another activist, Baibolat Kunbolatuly, son of Tursyn. They were held at the police department for several hours and released without charge, Kunbolatuly told RFE/RL.

There was no comment from authorities, and calls by RFE/RL to the police department were not answered.

Kaliolla published a video on Facebook purporting to show the demonstrators and police officers following behind them.

One of the demonstrators, Almakhan Myrzan, held a photograph of her brother, religious researcher Baqytkhan Myrzan, who died earlier this month in custody in a penitentiary in Xinjiang.

Myrzan sharply condemned the authorities for her brother's death, which she confirmed to RFE/RL on March 9. He had been sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2018 for performing an Islamic ritual at a religious event.

She also said that authorities in Xinjiang had ignored demands by Myrzan's relatives in China and Kazakhstan to release him due to a medical condition.

Almakhan Myrzan has been among dozens of people who for more than two years have been picketing the Chinese Embassy in Astana and the consulate in Almaty to demand the release of relatives held in correctional facilities in China.

China has been accused of human rights violations against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities over the existence of mass detention camps in Xinjiang Province. The crackdown has seen Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and Xinjiang's other indigenous ethnic groups sent to the camps.

Beijing denies the facilities are internment camps, saying its actions are aimed at combating terrorism, but people who have fled the province say people from the ethnic groups are undergoing ""political indoctrination"" at a network of facilities officially referred to as reeducation camps.

The demonstration and detentions in Almaty took place as Kazakh President Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev met in Astana with Ma Xingrui, the Communist Party secretary in Xinjiang.

Toqaev hailed the ""eternal friendship"" with Beijing as he welcomed the ""deepening all-round cooperation with China,"" Kazakhstan's presidency said.

China is among key investors in the oil-rich country, which is home to a large Uyghur diaspora, while around 1.5 million ethnic Kazakhs live in Xinjiang.

Ma said Kazakhstan was a ""priority area"" of mutual cooperation.

""In general, China's cooperation with Kazakhstan is carried out through Xinjiang,"" Ma added.

Ma's visit to Astana, which was not widely reported, took place 10 days after the Kazakh ambassador to China, Shakhrat Nuryshev, made a trip to Xinjiang and met with Ma.

Kazakh authorities refrain from openly criticizing the policies of China, one of their main creditors. They have responded to the demands of ethnic Kazakhs for the release of their relatives by saying that what is happening in China is an internal affair of the country, and have said the applications of separated family members are considered ""through diplomatic channels.""",Freedom of assembly

Kaliolla published a video on Facebook purporting to show the demonstrators and police officers following behind them.

One of the demonstrators, Almakhan Myrzan, held a photograph of her brother, religious researcher Baqytkhan Myrzan, who died earlier this month in custody in a penitentiary in Xinjiang.

Myrzan sharply condemned the authorities for her brother's death, which she confirmed to RFE/RL on March 9. He had been sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2018 for performing an Islamic ritual at a religious event.

She also said that authorities in Xinjiang had ignored demands by Myrzan's relatives in China and Kazakhstan to release him due to a medical condition.

Almakhan Myrzan has been among dozens of people who for more than two years have been picketing the Chinese Embassy in Astana and the consulate in Almaty to demand the release of relatives held in correctional facilities in China.

China has been accused of human rights violations against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities over the existence of mass detention camps in Xinjiang Province. The crackdown has seen Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and Xinjiang's other indigenous ethnic groups sent to the camps.

Beijing denies the facilities are internment camps, saying its actions are aimed at combating terrorism, but people who have fled the province say people from the ethnic groups are undergoing ""political indoctrination"" at a network of facilities officially referred to as reeducation camps.

The demonstration and detentions in Almaty took place as Kazakh President Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev met in Astana with Ma Xingrui, the Communist Party secretary in Xinjiang.

Toqaev hailed the ""eternal friendship"" with Beijing as he welcomed the ""deepening all-round cooperation with China,"" Kazakhstan's presidency said.

China is among key investors in the oil-rich country, which is home to a large Uyghur diaspora, while around 1.5 million ethnic Kazakhs live in Xinjiang.

Ma said Kazakhstan was a ""priority area"" of mutual cooperation.

""In general, China's cooperation with Kazakhstan is carried out through Xinjiang,"" Ma added.

Ma's visit to Astana, which was not widely reported, took place 10 days after the Kazakh ambassador to China, Shakhrat Nuryshev, made a trip to Xinjiang and met with Ma.

Kazakh authorities refrain from openly criticizing the policies of China, one of their main creditors. They have responded to the demands of ethnic Kazakhs for the release of their relatives by saying that what is happening in China is an internal affair of the country, and have said the applications of separated family members are considered ""through diplomatic channels.""",Right to Protest

81,Philippines,Philippines: NGO cashier wrongfully convicted of terrorist financing,30/03/2023,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced the first conviction under Republic Act 10168 or the Terrorism Financing Prevention and Suppression Act of 2012 after an Iligan City court found a cashier of a non-government organization guilty of being an accessory to terrorist financing.

In a statement, the DOJ said Angeline Magdua, one of two cashiers of the Rural Missionaries of the Philippines (RMP) Northern Mindanao, was convicted of 55 counts of violating Section 7 of the law, which penalizes being an accessory to the crime of terrorist financing.

RMP Northern Mindanao is a non-government organization composed of priests and laypersons that the DOJ said obtained donations from “unsuspecting” foreign organizations to finance the operations of the Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed wing the New People’s Army. The CPP and NPA have been designated as terrorist organizations by the United States Department of State, the European Union, New Zealand and the Philippine government.

“The department views this as a major win for our justice system and the fight against terrorism. Terrorism only leads to more violence and suffering, and we must break this cycle and work toward peace,” Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said.

The landmark decision comes 11 years after the enactment of the law, and will serve as the foundation for future prosecutions under this law.

The RMP had previously refuted the allegations leveled against it and accused government authorities of intimidating witnesses into making false statements that implicate its officers and members in the activities of the CPP-NPA.

The RMP is a national organization whose mission is to serve impoverished communities.

Founded in August 1969, RMP was established as a mission partner of the Association of Major Religious Superiors, with the goal of uplifting marginalized communities through various initiatives such as education, health services and community development.",Right to liberty and security
82,Afghanistan,Afghanistan: women protest disbanded,01/05/2023,"

At least 20 Afghan women marched in the capital, Kabul, on March 26 to demand the right to education for women and girls before being rounded up by a Taliban patrol.

The demonstration comes amid UN and other international condemnation over ongoing strictures under the Taliban-led government to keep women and girls out of schools, jobs, media, and other aspects of life since the hard-line militant group took power after U.S.-led international forces left in 2021.

Participants in the demonstration told RFE/RL's Radio Azadi that Taliban enforcers arrived shortly after they began their planned march from the Red Bridge area in western Kabul and corralled the protesters to prevent them from continuing.

Video footage shared on social media showed around two dozen veiled women marching with small signs with ""education is our right"" written on them.

The demonstration was organized by the Afghan Women's Political Participation Network.

Organizers reportedly planned to march toward the Asif Mayel Girls' School, one of dozens of schools violently attacked by Taliban fighters or sympathizers.

""For almost two years, the future and fate of Afghan women have been taken hostage and we have been completely removed from society,"" one of the protesters, Momine Eftekhari, told Radio Azadi.

""Education is a standard with an educational curriculum that is the right of everyone. Not only is it the right of boys but girls, but unfortunately we have been deprived of education, work, and sports for more than 19 months.""

She said the situation was ""no longer tolerable [and] that's why we took to the streets.""

The three main missing to this day.

“We and their families are deeply concerned about the physical and mental well being of the sugarworkers who remain disappeared to this day. This brings back memories of our harrowing experiences looking and searching for our loved ones who were abducted by state forces, many of whom were never found,” expressed Billet Batrallo, Vice-Chairperson of Desaparecidos.

“We call on the 59th Infantry Battalion Philippine Army(IB PA) under the 2nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Army, the identified perpetrator, to immediately and unconditionally surface the sugarworkers,” Batrallo added.

Desaparecidos also expresses deep concern on the series of intelligence operations, harrasments and interrogation of sugarworkers’ communities in Batangas.

“We call upon the Philippine Commission on Human Rights to conduct a thorough investigation into the abductions, the army unit’s lies and false claims against the sugarworkers of Batangas and the series of harassments and interrogation of people in the communities,” said Batralo.

Desaparecidos likewise strongly questions the stationing of the 59th IBPA near the area of the sugarworkers. Batrallo asserted: “Their presence only makes the people in the communities uneasy, scared and insecure. They have no business and no right roaming around intimidating and harrassing the people.There is no peace with them staying near the community.

“We stand by and support the leaders, members and organizers of SUGAR-Batangas. We will not be intimidated by these acts of violence and oppression. We will continue to fight for our rights and the rights of the sugarfolk communities in Batangas,” Batrallo concluded.",Right to healthy and safe environment

85,Philippines,Philippines: NGO worker and SOGI rights defender killed,02/05/2023,"

Human rights alliance Karapatan condemned the killing last April 25, 2023 of Alex Dolorosa, a fulltime union organizer and paralegal officer of the BPO Employees Network (BIEN). He was also an LGBTQ activist under Be GLad (BPO Employees, Gay, Lesbians and Allies for Genuine Acceptance and Democracy). Dolorosa was found dead in Barangay Alijis, Bacolod City with multiple stab wounds. He was last seen alive on the evening of April 23.

Citing reports from BIEN, Karapatan secretary general Cristina Palabay said Dolorosa had experienced “state surveillance and harassment on January 25, 2021; January 4, 2022; and May 4, 2022.” BIEN said the first harassment incident was at the office of militant party-list organization Bayan Muna in Bacolod City, while the second and third incidents were at the local Gabriela office. During one of the Gabriela incidents, Dolorosa took a video of a surveillance team’s vehicle, causing the driver to speed off. Dolorosa had also reported seeing two men surveilling his residence in Bata Subdivision. The experience prompted him to move residences.

Palabay supported BIEN’s call for justice for the slain union officer and paralegal officer, and urged the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) to conduct an investigation into the matter, taking as context the multiple harassments suffered by the victim prior to his death under suspicious circumstances.

86,India,"India: students beaten, arrested for staging a demonstration",24/04/2023,"As a repercussion, Delhi University (DU) debarred two students for a year for screening the controversial BBC documentary on Gujarat Riots. The move has not gone down well with the student community, which organised a mass sit-in protest today, March 24. However, the situation went further downhill with police appearing on the scene.

""Students gathered at Arts' Faculty against the arbitrary notice debarring two students have been brutally beaten, manhandled and detained,"" says Anjali, Secretary, DU unit of All India Students' Association (AISA). She tells that as the students started to speak on the ""arbitrary"" debarring notice, police, guards and CRPF personnel arrived and took the students away.

About 20-25 students have been detained at the Burari police station, the student informed. ""We will not be silenced by such measures. To protect our campus democracy, dissent will continue until this notice is withdrawn,"" she added.

Speaking about what led to today's protest, DU AISA president Manik Gupta said they got to know about the students being debarred from media reports. ""The university did not communicate anything in writing to the students. After the order was issued we went to the Proctor for clarification and submitted a memorandum, demanding that the action taken against the students be revoked,"" he said.

""Thrashing such punishment will not only be bad for the democratic environment of the campus but will also severely affect the concerned students,"" the document says. However, the Proctor did not listen to the students, they claim, but were told notices would be issued. the meeting took place on Tuesday, March 21 and the said notices were issued on March 22.

The students organised a protest march after this on the same day, in front of the Arts' Faculty, demanding that the notices be taken back. But when nothing such happened, they decided on the sit-in protest, which they had planned to continue indefinitely.

According to a report by PTI, various student groups screened the documentary on January 27. On March 17, DU took action against 8 students, including the two debarred students, Ravinder and Lokesh Chugh. The other six students were doled out a ""less strict punishment"", as mentioned in a memorandum issued by the university. Manik informs that these students were asked to submit apology letters to the administration.

Nonetheless, they are irked over the varsity's stand. ""The documentary was not banned. As a democratic campus, students should be free to pursue any activity of their choice. Barring students is not just,"" the president says with concern. The student also raises questions about how the whole exercise was carried out.

""We went to meet the Proctor with Ravinder, but he was not recognised. How can a student be debarred and not recognised? It is a huge deal, after all! Next, the media reports quoted the university's statement that Ravinder belongs to Law. But he is a student of Philosophy!"" Manik says in a distressed tone. 

Asked why action was taken against these particular students, he said, ""I feel they were randomly chosen. I have spoken to Lokesh, who is a PhD scholar, and he asserts that he wasn't even present at the screening."" The student body representative adds a committee was set up to look into the screening incident, but the inquiries were conducted by it in a highly arbitrary fashion.

With these instances, topped with today's detention incident, the students seem to be planning another protest.

87,Indonesia,Indonesia: Environmental rights defender arrested again (Update),25/04/2023,"The National Human Rights Commission (Komnas HAM) confirmed that environmental activist and human rights defender, Heri Budiawan alias Budi Pego, was arrested and subsequently detained at the Banyuwangi Penitentiary. Budi Pego, who was very outspoken against PT Merdeka Copper Gold's mining activities in Tumpang Pitu, was previously detained 10 months after the East Java High Court's verdict upheld the Banyuwangi District Court's verdict. Budi Pego's arrest and detention on Friday (24/3/2023) was the execution of the Supreme Court's decision through Decision Number 1567 K/PidSus/2018 which sentenced him to 4 years in prison. Komnas HAM, which once issued a protection letter for Budi Pego in 2018 as a ""human rights defender"", regretted the execution of this Supreme Court decision and firmly stated that the case against Budi Pego was criminalization.

Moreover, Budi Pego's family and attorneys are said to have never received a copy of the Supreme Court decision. ""What Budi Pego is demanding was not done at all because it was just an attempt to criminalize him, limiting his space for movement to advocate against mining that has been destroying the surrounding environment, and several other notes related to the Tumpang Pitu mining activity in Banyuwangi,"" said the Coordinator of the Promotion Sub-Commission HAM, Anis Hidayah, in a press conference, Sunday (26/3/2023). ""Budi Pego himself does not understand what Marxism, communism and Leninism are, the fact is that at trial the banner was not made by residents and the evidence was lost,"" added Komnas HAM's commissioner for complaints, Hari Kurniawan, on the same occasion. Responding to the execution of Budi Pego, Komnas HAM stated several positions.

First, asking Indonesian President Joko Widodo to grant amnesty to Budi Pego. Second, urging that the legal process, including at a higher court level (if legal proceedings for judicial review/PK are later carried out), can be carried out independently, impartially, transparently and fairly in accordance with human rights principles, and guarantees Budi Pego's rights. ""Third, asking the Minister of the Environment to immediately issue a Minister of Environment Regulation concerning the Protection of Human Rights Defenders in the Environmental Sector,"" said Anis. Fourth, Komnas HAM asked the East Java Provincial Government, Banyuwangi Police, and PT. Merdeka Copper Gold together with its subsidiaries, namely PT Bumi Suksesindo and PT Damai Suksesindo to comply with the recommendations issued by Komnas HAM number 0.961/R-PMT/VI/2020 dated 10 June 2020 to prioritize business and human rights principles.

Komnas HAM claims to have actively coordinated with various parties to ensure Budi Pego is in good condition and being detained according to human rights principles.

Criminalization of Budi Pego since 2017-
Since 2015, Komnas HAM has received complaints from the public that reject the existence of the Mount Tumpang Pitu gold mine in Pesanggaran District, Banyuwangi Regency which is managed by PT Bumi Suksesindo. The company is a subsidiary of PT Merdeka Copper Gold Tbk, with a mining business license for production operations since 2012. This permit has raised objections from residents around the mine, because the operation of this mine has an impact on socio-ecological aspects and the safety of people's living space in 5 villages, namely Sumberagung, Pesanggaran, Sumbermulyo, Kandangan and Sarongan villages. Budi Pego, together with dozens of Pesanggaran residents, then carried out a banner display against the Tumpang Pitu gold mine on April 4 2017.

""However, in the midst of the banner display, there was an insert banner bearing the hammer and sickle logo, which was clearly not made by the residents,"" said Hari Kurniawan in a press conference, Sunday (26/3/2023). ""Even when the residents made dozens of banners, they were supervised by the Babinmas and Babinkamtibmas of Pesanggaran District,"" he continued. Furthermore, Budi Pego was charged and tried for violating the provisions of Article 107a of the Criminal Code, deemed to have taught the teachings of Marxism, communism and engineering.

""Budi Pego is a former Indonesian migrant worker in Saudi Arabia who is also devout in worship and a member of the Pagar Nusa Pencak Silat School which is a Silat College under Nahdlatul Ulama,"" said the man who is familiarly called Wawan. The Banyuwangi District Court sentenced Budi Pego to 10 months in prison in 2017. Prosecutors and lawyers both appealed, but the East Java High Court's decision strengthened the Banyuwangi District Court's decision.

89,India,India: Kashmiri prominent defender in detention faces a fresh case (Update),01/05/2023,"On 22 March 2023, a court in New Delhi remanded human rights defender Khurram Parvez to the
custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for ten days in relation to a new case filed
against him. Khurram Parvez has been incarcerated for over a year at the Rohini High Security
Prison in New Delhi since his arrest under a separate First Information Report (FIR) on 22
November 2021. The latest case against Khurram Parvez was registered by the NIA in October
2020 following a raid at his office the Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society (JKCCS) alleging
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) of serious offences including criminal conspiracy and
terror funding.
Khurram Parvez is the Chairperson of the Asian Federation Against Involuntary Disappearances
(AFAD), a collective of 13 non-governmental organisations from ten Asian countries that campaign
on the issue of enforced disappearances. He is also the Program Coordinator of JKCCS, which is
a coalition of various campaign, research and advocacy organisations based in Srinagar, Jammu
and Kashmir that monitor and investigate human rights abuses. He was recently awarded the
prestigious Martin Ennals Award in February 2023.
On 22 March 2023, Khurram Parvez was produced before a special NIA judge at the Patiala House
court in New Delhi for the first time since his arbitrary arrest and detention on 22 November 2021
under a separate case. He was remanded to ten days of NIA custody along with Kashmiri journalist
Irfan Mehraj, who was also arrested in the same case on 20 March 2023. The case First
Information Report (FIR) No RC-37/2020, against Khurram Parvez and Irfan Mehraj was registered
in October 2020 under Sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 124-A (inciting disaffection
towards government through words, signs, etc.) of the Indian Penal Code and the Unlawful
Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) sections 17 (fund raising for terror activities), 18 (conspiracy to
commit terror act), 22A & 22C (relating to offences committed by registered companies), 38
(offence relating to membership of a terrorist organisation), 39 (supporting a terrorist organisation)
and 40 (raising funds for a terrorist organisation).
According to a press release by the NIA on 21 March 2023, Irfan Mehraj was stated to be a close
associate of human rights defender Khurram Parvez. Front Line Defenders was reliably informed
that the NIA interrogated Khurram Parvez for two consecutive days in the Rohini High Security
Prison in New Delhi the week previous. They had threatened him with arrest in relation to this case
from October 2020, and with arrests of his other colleagues and associates. There is a very
serious risk of other human rights defenders associated with JKCCS being targeted as reprisal for
their links to Khurram and peaceful human rights work.
Khurram Parvez’s arbitrary arrest and detention in November 2021 was widely condemned by UN
experts and human rights organisations. On 22 November 2021, the NIA raided Khurram Parvez’s
house and office for approximately 14 hours, seizing his and his family members’ laptops, mobile
phone, and books. After the raid, he was arrested by the NIA on the basis of a FIR lodged on 6
November 2021. Khurram Parvez was charged under the Indian Penal Code and the UAPA. On 13
May 2022, the NIA filed a preliminary charge sheet before the NIA Special Court in New Delhi and
accused Khurram Parvez of “running a network of over ground workers of the Pakistan-based
armed militant organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), for furthering activities of LeT and to commit
terrorist attacks in India”. His detention has been extended at least five times by the NIA Special
Court in New Delhi under Section 43D(2)(b) of the UAPA, which allows for the extension of the
detention period for up to 180 days if the investigating agency is unable to complete the
investigation of a case within a 90-day period.
Indian authorities have repeatedly targeted the human rights defender for his work in Kashmir. In
2016, he was detained for over two months and blocked from travelling to the United Nations
Human Rights Council in Geneva.
Front Line Defenders strongly condemns the continued persecution of human rights defender
Khurram Parvez including his ongoing incarceration and the fresh case under UAPA brought
against him in 2023. Front Line Defenders is deeply concerned about the increasing harassment of
activists and journalists in Kashmir and calls on the authorities in India to immediately and
unconditionally release Khurram Parvez and quash the fabricated charges against him.",Right to liberty and security
90,Thailand,Thailand: pro-democracy HRD issued arrest warrant,02/05/2023,"The Taling Chan Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for activist Chukiat Sangwong after he missed a court hearing following an accident, claiming that it believes he is trying to delay the case by refusing to come to court.

Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR) reported that on 22 March, the Taling Chan District Court issued an arrest warrant for Chukiat, who was charged with royal defamation for giving a speech at a protest on 2 November 2020, after he missed a witness examination hearing.

TLHR said that Chukiat’s lawyer requested that his court hearing be moved, as he has had an accident, during which he hit his head, and he still has a headache and was not able to come to court as he still hospitalized.

The court then ruled that the witness examination would be conducted without the defendant present, but Chukiat’s lawyer objected, as the charge carries a high penalty and the lawyer needs to consult the defendant in fighting the charge.

Chukiat’s lawyer said that the judge left the courtroom to consult with the Talingchan Criminal Court Chief Justice before returning to the courtroom and issuing a ruling that the Court does not think Chukiat is too sick to come to court and believes that he is trying to delay the case and avoiding coming to court. It then issued an arrest warrant for him and fined his bailsman.

On 23 March, the court once again refused to postpone the appointment, even though Chukiat’s lawyer submitted a certificate from his doctor stating that he still has a headache and is suffering from vertigo. The certificate also said that he received an injection that makes him drowsy and is not able to travel to court.

The court also refuse to repeal the arrest warrant, and said that, because it is not sure when he can be arrested, it will temporarily strike his case and cancel all witness examination hearings until he can be brought to court. It also said that if he has not come to court within three months, it will hold a trial as it sees fit.

Chukiat posted on his Facebook page on 23 March that he will go to court with his lawyer and bailsman as soon as his condition improves. He also wrote that he will not flee and will turn himself in as soon as he recovers, because he is also facing other charges for which witness examination is almost completed.",Right to health

93,Singapore,Singapore: Human rights lawyer suspended for five years after accusing the attorney-general's office,30/03/2023,"Singapore’s highest court Tuesday suspended human rights lawyer M. Ravi for five years over comments criticizing the city-state’s attorney general, the maximum sentence possible. A prominent human rights lawyer who is known internationally for representing death-row inmates in Singapore, Ravi has spent the better part of his 20-year career advocating for human rights and access to justice.

After helping a client avoid the death penalty in 2020, Ravi claimed that the Attorney General (AG) was “overzealous” in prosecuting his client during an interview for an online publication. Instead of apologizing or retracting his statements, as requested in a letter AG sent to Ravi, he posted the letter on Facebook, saying that he was “entitled to [his] criticisms of the unfairness associated to the miscarriage of justice.” He also threatened to sue the Law Society of Singapore if did not protect the independence of lawyers or participated in any ongoing harassment against him.

In response, the AG filed a complaint with the Law Society. Ravi was initially held responsible and ordered to pay a $6,000 penalty for making “baseless” accusations. Eventually, the case reached the Singapore Court of Appeal, the country’s highest court.

Given Ravi’s history of similar disciplinary behaviour and the “aggravated” circumstances of this case, the Court of Appeal found it appropriate to impose the maximum sanction since his misconduct has actively undermined “public confidence in the integrity of the legal system and legal profession.” In imposing the maximum sanction, the court held:

The whole tenor of Mr Ravi’s arguments at the hearing made it evident that he viewed himself as a victim of what he believed to be a dishonourable system that tolerated the improper abuse of prosecutorial power by the AG et al, the abnegation of duty by the court to initiate the review process, and the need to contend with the “sword of Damocles” that the AG and the Law Society had set over him during the course of his representation in the Gobi (Review) proceedings and over the legal profession at large. Within this allegedly unjust and oppressive system, Mr Ravi cast himself as someone who was simply “zealously pursuing … [his] cause [and] the oath [he had] taken to the rule of law”.

Malaysian rights group Lawyers for Liberty (LFL) has publicly condemned the Law Society for staying silent and failing to protect one of their own in the face of harassment and intimidation. LFL also warned Ravi’s suspension would have devastating impacts on the rights of many Malaysian death-row inmates.

95,India,India: Kashmiri journalist arbitrarily arrested under draconian law,30/03/2023,"National Investigation Agency of India on Tuesday said that it has arrested a Kashmiri journalist in connection with an NGO-militancy case in the Srinagar district.

In a statement to GNS, the NIA said, “Following comprehensive investigations into the NGO militancy funding case registered in October 2020, the National Investigation Agency arrested Irfan Mehraj from Srinagar yesterday (20, 03, 2023). Irfan Mehraj was a close associate of Khurram Parvez and was working with his organization, Jammu and Kashmir Coalition of Civil Societies (JKCCS). Investigation revealed that the JKCCS was funding militant activities in the valley and had also been in the propagation of secessionist agenda in the Valley under the garb of protection of human rights.”

The spokesman further stated that the involvement of some Valley-based NGOs, trusts and societies in the funding of militancy-related activities is being probed in this case.

“Some NGOs, both registered as well as un-registered, have come to notice collecting funds domestically and abroad under the cover of doing charity and various welfare activities, including Public Health, Education etc. But some of these organisations have developed links with proscribed militant organizations, such as Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT), Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), etc,” reads the statement.

Irfan was formerly a researcher with Khurram’s human rights organization Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society.

The LinkedIn profile of Irfan Mehraj reads: “I am an independent journalist and researcher based in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir (India). My work has appeared in TRT World, Indian Express, The Caravan, Kashmir Life, Kashmir Reader, and Greater Kashmir among others.”

Earlier, Suchitra Vijayan, the author of ‘Midnight’s Borders’ tweeted, “Kashmiri journalist Irfan Mehraj was arrested by the National Investigation Agency under draconian UAPA in Srinagar today. He has been moved to Delhi,” she said adding that Irfan is a reporter and the founding editor of Wande Magazine.

Quoting Irfan’s father Mehraj-ud-Din Bhat, The Wire report said, NIA had called the journalist to appear in its office at Church Lane Srinagar on March 20. He was out on a professional assignment when he received a call. He was told to come over to their office for five minutes. Later, he said, they came to know that Irfan had been arrested and was going to be shifted to Delhi today.

“My son is innocent. His work speaks for him loudly. I have full faith that truth will prevail and he will get justice,” the report quoted Bhat as saying.

Besides Irfan, three journalists from Kashmir Fahad Shah, Asif Sultan and Sajad Gul are among five journalists in India who are currently facing detention under various sections of the law.

Journalists, Siddique Kappan of Kerala and Manan Dar of Kashmir, who were also mentioned in the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) December 8, 2022 report, were released on bail recently. Dar was released on January 2, 2023, and Kappan on February 2, 2023.

Dar was arrested on 22 October 2021 for over a year, and Kappan was released 28 months after he was arrested, along with three others, near Mathura while going towards Hathras, where a Dalit girl had been raped and killed by Hindu men.

Earlier in 2021, the New York-based international press freedom watchdog called upon the Indian government to drop investigations into the work of Kashmiri journalists and allow them to report without “harassment, intimidation, and criminal investigations.”

Meanwhile, reacting to the Irfan’s arrest, former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Mehbooba Mufti said that draconian laws like the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act or UAPA are being “abused constantly” to ensure that the process itself becomes the punishment.

Mehbooba tweeted: “While conmen are given a free run in Kashmir, journalists like Irfan Mehraj are arrested for doing their duty by speaking the truth. Draconian laws like UAPA are abused constantly to ensure that the process itself becomes the punishment, (SIC).”",Right to liberty and security

97,India,India: Journalist arrested after posting the alleged involvement of a lawmaker in illegal gambling activities,19/04/2023,"On March 18, 2023, police in the Indian state of Haryana arrested Jaspal Singh, a TV journalist who reports part-time for the local broadcaster News18 Haryana, from his home in the city of Ratia, according to news reports and Rajesh Kundu, editor of the news website The Ink, who is familiar with the case and spoke with CPJ by phone.

Police arrested Singh after a first information report was filed earlier that day by the Ratia Sadar police station in the state’s Fatehabad district, which opened an investigation into Singh and an unnamed journalist based on a complaint by the son of a local official, according to those sources and a copy of the report reviewed by CPJ.

Sumit Kumar, the son of Lakshman Napa, a member of the Haryana legislative assembly with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, filed that complaint, accusing the two journalists of defaming his father’s “political image” through their alleged false posts on two WhatsApp groups claiming the lawmaker was involved in illegal gambling activities and questioning why police had not apprehended him.

Kumar also accused Singh of targeting his father because the legislator belongs to a vulnerable caste group protected under Indian law. Although the complaint notes that the posts were widely distributed, CPJ was unable to review the posts, which were published in two private WhatsApp groups with around 400 members.

Singh regularly posts political commentary in those groups in his individual capacity and as a journalist, Kundu said.

Kundu told CPJ that he believes Singh was targeted for being a journalist, as other members posted the same allegations but only Singh and the unidentified journalist were mentioned in the complaint. 

The first information report says that Singh is under investigation for extortion, defamation, transmitting obscene material in electronic form, and attempting to promote feelings of enmity, hatred, or ill-will against members of scheduled castes or tribes. Each offense can carry a punishment of two to five years’ imprisonment and an undisclosed fine.

Promoting feelings of enmity, hatred, or ill-will is a non-bailable offense, therefore requiring Singh to apply for bail at the Fatehabad District and Sessions Court rather than the lower court where his case was heard on March 19, Kundu told CPJ. Kundu told CPJ he did not know when Singh would be able to present his application for bail at the district and sessions court.

98,Kyrgyzstan,Kyrgyzstan: court uphold decision to block independent media outlet (Update),19/03/2023,"The Lenin district court in Bishkek has started a hearing into a request from Kyrgyzstan's Culture Information, Sports, and Youth Policies Ministry to halt the operations of RFE/RL's Kyrgyz Service, known locally as Radio Azattyk and officially registered as Azattyk Media in the Central Asian nation.

The judge opened the hearing on March 17 by allowing the first 20 minutes of the session to be recorded.

The ministry's official request to halt Radio Azattyk's operations as a media outlet was filed with the court in late January.

According to the ministry, the request was made due to Radio Azattyk's refusal to remove from the Internet a video about clashes last year along a disputed segment of the Kyrgyz-Tajik border.

Kyrgyz authorities blocked Radio Azattyk’s websites in Kyrgyz and Russian in late October when the video report in question -- which was produced by Current Time, a Russian-language network run by RFE/RL in cooperation with Voice of America -- was left on the sites.

Officials of the Central Asian nation have claimed that the authors of the video ""predominantly"" took the position of the Tajik side.

RFE/RL President and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Fly has said the broadcaster ""takes our commitment to balanced reporting seriously"" and that after a review of the content in question, ""no violation of our standards"" was found.

The authorities' decision was based on the Law on Protection from False Information, legislation that drew widespread criticism when it was adopted in August 2021.

Radio Azattyk's bank account in Bishkek was frozen at the time, and in November, Kyrgyz authorities suspended the accreditations of 11 RFE/RL correspondents at the country's parliament.

The Kyrgyz government's decision has been criticized by domestic and international human rights watchdogs, Kyrgyz politicians, celebrities, intellectuals, journalists, lawmakers, and rights activists, who have called for the government to repeal it.

RFE/RL has appealed against the move to block the sites with Bishkek's Birinchi Mai district court.

Earlier this month, Bishkek's Administrative Court rejected an appeal launched by RFE/RL that sought to have the October move to block the sites overturned.

99,Maldives,"Maldives: media worker arrested, assaulted",19/03/2023,"Maldives authorities should investigate the police assault of journalist Hussain Juman, refrain from filing any charges against him in retaliation for his work, and ensure members of the press can cover protests freely, the Committee to Protect Journalists said Friday.

On the evening of Thursday, March 16, Maldives police assaulted and arrested Juman, a reporter for the privately owned news website Avas, while he covered a rally by supporters of the opposition Progressive Party of Maldives in the capital city of Malé, according to a tweet by the Maldives Journalists Association and the journalist, who spoke with CPJ by phone.

Authorities released him without charge on Friday afternoon, following an order by the Maldives Criminal Court. Juman told CPJ that he did not know if police intended to file charges against him in the future.

“Maldives authorities must swiftly investigate the police assault of journalist Hussain Juman and hold the officers responsible to account,” said Beh Lih Yi, CPJ’s Asia program coordinator. “In the run-up to September’s presidential election, Maldives authorities must ensure the media can cover political rallies without fear of being targeted or assaulted. Journalists are doing their jobs to keep voters informed.”   

Protesters had gathered calling for the release of PPM leader Abdulla Yameen, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison on corruption and money laundering charges in December.

Juman was filming the rally when police shoved him to the ground and threw his phone away, according to a video of the incident posted to Twitter and the journalist, who said he sustained injuries to his chest, shoulder, and back.

Juman was held in an overcrowded cell with around 12 others in the Malé custodial detention center before being presented in the Maldives Criminal Court on Friday afternoon, he said.

At that hearing, state lawyers asked the court to extend Juman’s detention for 15 days pending an investigation into allegations that he disturbed police functions and physically assaulted officers at the rally, Juman told CPJ.

After reviewing the video of officers assaulting Juman, the court denied the state lawyers’ request due to insufficient evidence and ordered his immediate release, he said.

Maldives Police Commissioner Mohamed Hameed told CPJ by phone that police will conduct an internal inquiry into the assault and arrest of Juman, and will determine whether he will be charged.

100,Cambodia,Cambodia: three media outlets licence revoked after publishing critical report,19/03/2023,"The Information Ministry revoked the licenses of three media outlets on Thursday after they published reports exposing a senior government official’s role in land fraud.

The Ministry stated that online Khmer language media outlets Federation of Cambodia-ASEAN Journalists, Raksmey Kampong Cham and Dumnong Knong Srok had “committed serious violations of journalistic ethics” and “not followed the instruction of the ministry.” 

Chea Lyheang, president and publisher of the Federation of Cambodia-ASEAN Journalists, expressed disappointment that the Ministry revoked his outlet’s license without clear explanation.

“We regret this, please show the exact issue and what mistake we have made,” Lyheang told CamboJA. 

Lyheang said the Information Ministry had called him for a meeting in February and requested that he remove articles alleging that government officials had forged documents in a land dispute and, in another case, involved in the extortion of poor families.

One report, published in all three outlets, revealed that senior ruling CPP National Assembly member Sar Chamrong, former deputy governor of Banteay Meanchey, allegedly forged documents to gain more than 60 hectares of land in Banteay Meanchey. 

“After seeing forged documents and thumb prints, I have published this information and Sar Chamrong has complained to the Information Ministry,” Lyheang said.

Chamrong heads the National Assembly’s Commission on Human Rights, Complaints and Investigations. In February 2020, Minister of Information Khieu Kanharith led a delegation to pay respects at the funeral of Chamrong’s mother.

Chamrong could not be reached for comment by CamboJA.

The Information Ministry claimed the articles damaged the honor of the officials named in the report, according to Lyheang.

“I replied that I cannot remove the information because it is real information, especially a lie to Prime Minister Hun Sen,” Lyheang said. 

Another article published in the three outlets revealed that a Takeo provincial deputy prosecutor had seized property from three families who bought it from Ratanakiri province and demanded they pay him money to get it back.

Chea Saren, publisher of Dumnong Knong Srok, published the same reports into land disputes and land fraud this year, including in a video segment receiving more than 169,000 views on Facebook. He said the Information Ministry requested he remove the articles, which he refused to do. 

“They [Information Ministry] had requested to remove those two articles but I didn’t follow [their request] because we have enough documents and are interviewing villagers,” he said. “We have published the real information of villagers, which might have impacted other people’s interests.”

Information Ministry spokesperson Meas Sophorn denied the Ministry had asked the media outlets to remove articles. 

“It isn’t true,” Sophorn said. “The decision to revoke licenses came because those media outlets have broadcasted disinformation with no verification of sources from relevant parties related to information they have published, and they didn’t make a correction to disinformation they had published.”

The spokesperson claimed that the land dispute in Banteay Meanchey province was already resolved and so there was no need to report further on it. He added the outlets had “violated journalistic professional ethics…stated in the Press Law.”

The Press Law states that anybody who believes they have been subject to a false report damaging them may file a civil suit to resolve the matter in court.

“For me, I want to see a thorough investigation of the cases before closing [the publications],” said Nop Vy, executive director of Cambodian Journalists Alliance Association (CamboJA).

Press freedom in Cambodia has worsened as a result of the closure of these outlets, he said. 

“From my perspective, if [the closure of media outlets] continues, it will not be a good image for our society, it could have a lot of impacts, especially impacting the push for transparency and [ability] to root out corruption in our society,” Vy said.

The government has previously censored the media for reporting information that it deems to damage the reputation of officials. 

In February, the government shut down independent media VOD and blocked access to its website for a report alleging the Prime Minister’s son Hun Manet had signed a document in place of his father to provide aid to Turkey.

“It is a lesson learned for other media institutions,” Minister of Information Khieu Kanharith said on his Facebook page after the announcement of VOD’s closure. “The media institutions that do not agree to publish clarifications, [they] will face the revocation of their licenses.”

The revocation of VOD’s license was condemned by a range of foreign embassies, the United Nations and human rights groups. But Prime Minister Hun Sen brushed off those concerns and said VOD’s shut down strengthened the Kingdom’s journalism by punishing what he claimed to be unprofessional reporting.

Following the loss of its license, outlet Dumnong Knong Srok posted a goodbye to followers on its Facebook page.

“Farewell to the professional journalists all over the Kingdom of Cambodia who are in love with the field of journalism,” Dumnong Knong Srok said in a Friday post. “Wish them good health and continue to spread true information to the society for the motherland.”",Media freedom

101,Thailand,Thailand: pro-democracy defender indicted for a speech,02/05/2023,"Activist Sopon Surariddhidhamrong has been indicted on a royal defamation charge for a speech given during a Labour Day protest on 1 May 2022 about access to Covid-19 vaccines, after the public prosecutor ruled that he insulted Princess Sirivannavari, who the public prosecutor sees as the heir to the throne.

Sopon was charged with royal defamation and using a sound amplifier without permission for giving a speech during the 1 May 2022 Labour Day protest at Government House, during which he spoke about the lack of access to Covid-19 vaccines and how certain privileged groups are getting access to vaccines ahead of everyone else.

Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR) said that the public prosecutor indicted Sopon because he said that Princess Sirivannavari, King Vajiralongkorn’s youngest daughter, and her friends were getting the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine before everyone else, and because he said that members of the royal family are getting the AstraZeneca vaccine while the people are denied access to it because the King is a shareholder in Siam Bioscience, the only company licensed to produce the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine in Thailand.

The public prosecutor indicted Sopon on the grounds that he insulted Princess Sirivannavari, who the prosecutor sees as the heir to the throne, and damaged her reputation, and that he caused a misunderstanding among the public that the King is the largest shareholder in the company and so his family and employees received early access to the vaccine.

The public prosecutor also said that because Sopon said that donations to hospitals were from taxpayers’ money, he has damaged the reputation of the monarchy by insinuating that the royal family did not really help the people but used taxpayers’ money to make donations, and that other parts of his speech implied that the monarchy oppresses the people.

TLHR noted that Sopon was indicted on 15 March 2023, but the public prosecutor stated that he was still held in detention on another charge at the time. However, Sopon was granted bail on 20 February 2023. The public prosecutor also called Sopon on 20 March 2023, telling him to post bail for himself after the indictment has already been filed, claiming that they had not not been able to contact Sopon or his lawyer.

Sopon and his lawyer went to court on 20 March 2023 to request bail on the grounds that he is still receiving treatment for the neurological symptoms resulting from prolonged sleep deprivation, after Sopon intentionally deprived himself of sleep while held in pre-trial detention earlier this year to demand the release of political prisoners. He was later granted bail using a 90,000-baht security covered by the Will of the People bail fund.

Under the current Palace Law of Succession, the King has the sole power to name a male member of the royal family as his heir, and upon being announced to the public, the heir’s position is “secure and indisputable.” He also has the sole power to remove the heir.

The Palace Law also outlines the line of succession, stating that the first-born son of the King and Queen is first in line, followed by his sons and his brothers. Under this law, Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti, King Vajiralongkorn’s youngest child and only officially recognized son, would be considered first in line for the throne ahead of his sisters, Princess Bajrakitiyabha, often hypothesized by the public as heir presumptive to the throne, and Princess Sirivannavari. Nevertheless, the King has yet to appoint an heir.

The Palace Law also states that women are excluded from the line of succession. However, the 2017 Constitution states that, in the event where the throne becomes vacant and the King has not appointed an heir, the Privy Council may submit the name of a successor to the throne to the Cabinet for the approval of the National Assembly, the combined parliament of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

102,Bangladesh,Bangladesh: media workers assaulted while covering elections,02/05/2023,"On March 15, police assaulted at least nine journalists on the court’s premises in the capital city of Dhaka after clashes broke out between lawyers supporting the ruling Awami League party and the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and police charged into the crowd swinging their batons, according to multiple news reports and five of those journalists, who spoke with CPJ.

The deputy commissioner of the Dhaka police’s Ramna division told news website Bdnews24.com later on March 15 that “journalists got caught up in the turmoil” when officers attempted to break up the unrest, and police were investigating the attacks.

On March 16, Dhaka police officials expressed regret over the incident in a meeting with local journalists but, as of March 29, have not held any of the officers involved in the attacks to account, the journalists told CPJ. 

“The recent apology by the Dhaka police over officers’ attacks on at least nine Bangladeshi journalists is a welcome but insufficient response,” said Carlos Martinez de la Serna, CPJ’s program director. “Bangladeshi authorities must hold the officers who attacked journalists to account, return any equipment confiscated from reporters, and ensure that police are thoroughly trained so they can help, rather than imperil, members of the press covering newsworthy events.”

Two officers with the police Public Order Management Division slapped Zabed Akhter, a senior reporter for the privately owned broadcaster ATN News, shoved him to the ground, and kicked him as he repeatedly identified himself as a journalist and told them he suffered from a nerve condition, Akhter told CPJ by phone.

Police also pushed Jannatul Ferdous Tanvi, a senior reporter for the privately owned broadcaster Independent Television, as she tried to help him, Akhter said.

Later that day, Akhter received medical treatment for internal injuries to his waist and back at a hospital, where the two officers apologized to the journalist, Akhter said, adding that those officers had not been held to account for the incident as of March 29.

A group of 10 to 15 officers kicked and used a bamboo stick to beat Md. Humaun Kabir, a senior camera operator for the privately owned broadcaster ATN Bangla who was filming the unrest, knocking him to the ground, Kabir told CPJ by phone. Officers continued to slap him as he ran away, according to a video of the incident reviewed by CPJ. Kabir sustained a head injury for which he took painkillers. 

Five or six officers beat Maruf Hasan, a reporter for the privately owned newspaper Manab Zamin, in the head and back while he identified himself as a journalist, he told CPJ via messaging app.  Officers also insulted him with vulgar language and confiscated his microphone, which they had not returned as of March 29, Hasan said.

He told CPJ that he sustained painful injuries to the areas that were beaten.

About five police officers also beat Mohammad Fazlul Haque, a senior reporter for the privately owned news website Jago News, according to Haque, who told CPJ via messaging app that he had been beaten but then did not respond to additional questions seeking details.  

According to those news reports and the journalists who spoke with CPJ, police also attacked Nur Mohammad, a reporter for the privately owned newspaper Ajker Patrika; Ibrahim Hossain, a camera operator for the privately owned broadcaster Boishakhi Television; Kabir Hossain, a reporter for the privately owned newspaper Kalbela; and Mehedi Hassan Dalim, a reporter for the privately owned news website The Dhaka Post.

CPJ contacted those journalists via messaging app seeking additional details but did not receive any replies.

Suvra Kanti Das, a senior photojournalist for the privately owned newspaper Prothom Alo, told CPJ by phone that he was also covering the elections when an officer grabbed him by the shirt, demanded to see his media identification card, insulted him with vulgar language, and ordered him to leave the premises, which he did.

103,China,China: veteran defender prevented from visiting ailing sister abroad,03/05/2023,"Authorities in the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang have slapped a travel ban on veteran democracy activist Zhu Yufu, as he prepared to travel to Japan to visit his terminally ill sister.

In his first interview with the media in five years, Zhu, 71, told Radio Free Asia that he had applied for, and gotten, a visa for Japan to visit his sister Zhu Yanmin in Sasebo, who is dying of cancer.

“My sister’s lung cancer is at an advanced stage, and she has already had surgery on both lungs,” he said. “All four of her cancer treatment plans have failed, and now her white blood cells are nearly zero, which is very dangerous.”

“That’s why I want to go and visit her now – the trip is for humanitarian reasons,” Zhu said.

Zhu, who was among a group of activists who applied for official permission to set up the now-banned China Democracy Party in 1998, has previously served time in jail for “incitement to subvert state power.”

He served a second jail term from 2012 for “subversion of state power” after he posted a political poem online titled “It’s Time,” calling on people to stand up for their freedom.

He has been under house arrest and close surveillance since his release from prison, and has spent the last two years navigating the bureaucracy necessary to get himself to Japan to visit his sister despite the restrictions of the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s zero-COVID policy, which ended last December.

In mid-March, however, he got a visit from state security police in his home in the eastern city of Hangzhou, who confiscated his passport and shattered his dream of meeting with his ailing sister one last time.

“They said if I left the country, I would become a focal point for other people,” Zhu said. “Nobody is being allowed to leave the country now.”

Zhu said he had retorted that the state security police didn’t want to lose the funding that came attached to his case under China’s draconian “stability maintenance” system, which seeks to nip potential political and social unrest in the bud by targeting activists seen as likely instigators.

“I haven’t opposed the Communist Party for more than 10 years,” Zhu said. “I haven’t given any interviews or written any articles.”

“All I have done is keep on trying to visit my sister.”

‘Top surveillance target’

Zhu said he has long been regarded as the No. 1 threat to social stability by authorities in his home province of Zhejiang.

“I’m the top surveillance target in Zhejiang,” he said. “I’m not allowed to leave Hangzhou, nor say or write anything.”

“There are several surveillance cameras downstairs in this building that were installed just to watch me,” he said. “They call me if I cross the Qiantang River [to leave town], and they come to my door every week to take photos.”

Zhu said he plans to ignore such restrictions now that he has been prevented from seeing his sister.

“I’m not going to comply from now on,” he said. “I’m going to do what I want to do.”

Fellow Hangzhou dissident Zou Wei called on the authorities to let Zhu leave for compassionate reasons.

“This is a form of political persecution,” Zou told Radio Free Asia.

“I hope the authorities will approve Zhu Yufu’s overseas trip to visit a terminally ill relative as soon as possible, on humanitarian grounds,” he said.

Activist Piyarat Chongtep and 18 other members of the group went to the Uruphong intersection on the night of 7 December 2020 to clear away razor wire left there by the police after it was used to block protest marches passing through the area. The group said they received complaints from people in the neighbourhood, who said that the razor wire was left scattered around the area, making it hard for them to move about. A community member said that the wire was blocking the alleyway, and that the police refused to remove it despite complaints from the community.

While collecting the razor wire, they were surrounded by several units of crowd control police and were arrested. They were then charged with participating in an assembly of more than 10 people and causing public disorder, not dispersing after receiving an official order, and resisting an official.

Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR) reported that on 24 March, the Criminal Court found the group guilty of participating in an assembly of more than 10 people and causing public disorder on the grounds that they were not responsible for collecting the razor wire and should have asked the responsible authorities to come and collect the wire, so the court ruled that they intended to hold an assembly and cause public disorder.

The group was given a prison sentence of 20 days, suspended for 2 years and were fined 6000 baht each. They also had to do 24 hours of community service and report to court 4 times per year for a year.

Piyarat, who is running as an MP candidate for the Move Forward Party, posted the verdict on his Facebook page, and said that the verdict does not affect his campaign because the prison sentence was suspended, and therefore does not disqualify him from running.

Piyarat also wrote that the charges he is facing for participating in the pro-democracy movement is a badge of honour for him and shows that he has the making of an MP, who must be a voice for the people and fight against injustice.",Right to Protest

105,Indonesia,Indonesia: Journalist intimidated for reporting on a new road built without compensation for residents,25/04/2023,"A number of journalists from Floresa.co, a local media from Flores, East Nusa Tenggara, were intimidated by TNI officers after reporting on the inauguration of the Labuan Bajo - Golo Mori road by President Joko Widodo, whose land was taken from residents without giving compensation.

The news entitled President Jokowi Inaugurates a Road in Labuan Bajo Built Without Compensation for Residents was published on March 14, while the intimidation that allegedly came from intelligence officers at the Manggarai District Military Command occurred on March 15.

The Floresa journalist who was contacted by Suara.com from Jakarta said that the intimidation was carried out over the phone by two people who claimed to be TNI officers from the Manggarai Kodim. They repeatedly called and sent messages via WhatsApp to the journalist.

The TNI officer called and asked the journalist to meet and ""have coffee together"".

""During the conversation, he immediately mentioned the name and area of ​​origin of the Floresa journalist, and said 'want to meet' because 'want to make new friends. If there is any information, share it with us. Let's drink coffee together',"" explained the journalist, imitating the invitation from the apparatus.

The following is a chronology of intimidation attempts that Floresa journalists received:

1. At 16.16 WITA, a Floresa journalist (A) received a call via WhatsApp from a new number. When picked up, the caller introduced himself as a TNI member named Ardo from the Manggarai Kodim. During the conversation, he immediately mentioned the name and area of ​​origin of the journalist, and said ""I want to meet"" because ""I want to make new friends."" ""If there is information, share it with us. We drink coffee together.""

When the journalist said he was in Labuan Bajo, the caller said he took part in providing security during President Jokowi's visit on March 14, 2023.

""If only I knew yesterday, we would've had coffee at Bajo,"" he said. After that, he said, ""might be annoying,"" then hung up on the journalist.

Before hanging up he confirmed the Floresa journalist's name. He also asked that his contact number be saved under Ardo's name. When the journalist checked his number through the Getcontact application, it was written ""Intel TNI Serda Ardo."" He called back at 16.21, but was not picked up by the journalist.

2. At 16.18 WITA, another Floresa journalist (B) received a greeting message from another number via the WhatsApp application. The Floresa journalist did not reply. Between 4:32 p.m. and 4:36 p.m., the number then made five voice calls, and did not receive a response.

3. The same number then contacted another Floresa journalist [C] at 16.38 WITA via the WhatsApp application. However, there was no response.

4. At almost the same time at 16.38 WITA the same number again contacted journalist Floresa (A). He introduced himself from the Manggarai Kodim. He asked whether it was true that journalist A wrote the news on President Jokowi's visit to Floresa. Journalist A answered, yes. After that he asked for the address of Floresa's office ""to meet for coordination."" Journalist A responded by saying, ""Regarding the news of the president's visit, I will convey it to the editor-in-chief and the Floresa editorial team."" Journalist A then asked the reason for the coordination regarding the news and what was wrong with the news, but was not answered.Then, journalist A asked him to turn off the phone.

5. After the call, he sent a message via WhatsApp to journalist A and again asked for ""Floresa's editorial number,"" while forwarding the news link ""President Jokowi Inaugurates Road in Labuan Bajo to be Built Without Compensation for Residents."" In his message, he invited Floresa journalists to meet at Starbucks, Labuan Bajo, which, again, he said was ""to coordinate"" regarding the news. However, the journalist did not respond to him and asked him to convey it directly if there was a problem with the news.

6. At 17.14 WITA, a journalist from another media in Labuan Bajo called journalist A, but he did not pick up. The journalist then called again at 17.23 WITA. The call lasted for 5 minutes, asking journalist A to meet with a person he described as a TNI intelligence.

The journalist said that the TNI intelligence agent had telephoned him, asking to become a liaison to bring journalist A together with the intelligence agent. He said the intelligence agent invited journalist A to meet because his boss asked him to find out the name of the journalist who wrote the news. Floresa journalists still chose not to follow the invitation.

Floresa said that the news about the inauguration of the troubled road by Jokowi in Labuan Bajo was a journalistic product that reported the issue of neglecting the rights of residents to receive compensation in the project.

""We consider that the efforts of the two intelligence agents are forms of intimidation and a serious disturbance of the journalistic work that we carry out,"" said Floresa in a press release.

According to Gatra.com monitoring, the disbandment  by the apparatus was carried out at 18.42 WIB via loudspeakers. However, even though the police had given this warning more or less three times, the demonstrators refused to leave the DPR building, because there was no certainty from the DPR whether there was any intention in listening to the people's aspirations.

The dispersal was carried out by the police, because the action had exceeded the specified time limit, in accordance with Police Chief Regulation No. 9 of 2008, for demonstrations in the open only until 18.00 WIB.

At 19.44 WIB the police asked representatives of the demonstrators to coordinate. And finally at 20.00 WIB, the masses of demonstrators began to leave in front of the DPR building.

""We will come back with more crowds,"" said a representative from the demonstration against the Perppu Ciptaker at the DPR, Tuesday (14/3).

""Us going home doesn't mean that we stop fighting,"" he continued.

As previously reported, according to Gatra.com monitoring, demonstrators began to crowd the DPR building starting at 10.00 WIB. As of 4:51 p.m. it was still observed that they had not left the DPR building.

A number of students also joined the protest against the Ciptaker Bill, one of which was from the University of Indonesia, which totalled around 20 students.

108,Thailand,Thailand: indigenous people's rights defender sentenced,19/03/2023,"A 38-year-old indigenous Karen man from Mae Hong Son has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for royal defamation and sedition over 4 Facebook posts and denied bail.

Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR) reported on Monday (13 March) that the Chiang Mai Provincial Court has found Phonchai Wimonsuphawong, 38, guilty of royal defamation, sedition, and violation of the Computer Crimes Act for 4 Facebook posts made between 18 October and 19 November 2020.

The complaint against him was filed by Jessada Thunkeaw, a former protest guard for the People’s Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC), who accused Phonchai of 4 Facebook posts about the King’s involvement in politics and inviting people to join protests. However, Phonchai said that he did not make the posts, as his Facebook account was stolen at the time.

Phonchai was arrested on 10 March 2021 at his residence in Nonthaburi on a warrant issued by the Chiang Mai Provincial Court. He was then denied bail and held in pre-trial detention at Chiang Mai Remand Prison for 44 days before being released on 22 April 2021.

On Monday (13 March), the Chiang Mai Provincial Court found him guilty on all 4 counts of royal defamation, sedition, and violation of the Computer Crimes Act on the grounds that the posts refer to King Vajiralongkorn using inappropriate language and contain false information, and also invited people to join illegal gatherings. He was sentenced to a total of 12 years in prison.

The court also ruled that, although Phonchai said his account was stolen, he did not present evidence that this was true, and he would have pressed charges or tried to find the culprit if his account was stolen. Since he said the account was his, and there is a video clip of Phonchai introducing himself on the account, the Court believes that he made the posts.

Following his sentencing, Phonchai’s lawyer filed a bail request, but the Chiang Mai District Court forwarded the request to the Appeal Court for consideration, and he was taken to Chiang Mai Remand Prison.

On Tuesday (14 March), the Appeal Court denied Phonchai bail on the grounds that he committed a serious offense, and since he was sentenced to 12 years in prison, he is likely to flee if released.

Phonchai was previously granted bail by the Yala Provincial Court, after he was found guilty of royal defamation and sentenced to 3 years in prison, reduced to 2 because he gave useful testimony. The Court also only found him guilty of a Facebook video he posted of himself talking about the pro-democracy protests in October 2020, and not for 2 other Facebook posts he said were made after his account was stolen, because evidence presented by the prosecution did not contain the posts’ URLs, and the inquiry officer testified that they were not sure if the images of the posts are accurate.

According to TLHR, he is also facing 5 other charges from joining protests in Bangkok. He received a fine in one case, while the public prosecutor dismissed another case.

38-year-old Phonchai comes from an indigenous Karen community in Mae Hong Son’s Mae La Noi District. After leaving home as a teenager, Phonchai worked in a restaurant in Chiang Mai in exchange for food and accommodation. He then decided to move to Bangkok to find work. He said in an interview with TLHR that he spent around a year homeless before getting a job as a security guard. Before he was charged, he has been working as a salesman, going from house to house selling mobile phones or helping real estate agents.

Phonchai said he first joined a protest on 14 October 2020, and then on 16 October 2020, both of which were met with police violence. He told TLHR that he wanted to be an example for indigenous people and show that they can participate in political movements and fight for their rights.

He noted that having to travel back and fourth from Nonthaburi to Yala and Chiang Mai meant he lost time he could have been working, and it cost him a considerable amount of money, but his travel expenses have been covered by the Da Torpedo Fund, which supports political prisoners and covers the expenses of people fighting political charges.

Phonchai said he joined the protests because he wanted to see changes in the country and because he wanted indigenous peoples to have equal access to rights and opportunities, such as education and employment, and for them to be free from discrimination.",Right to liberty and security

She received a total fine of 34,000 baht.

Worawan, or “Auntie Pao,” a 68-year-old fruit vendor who regularly attends protests and is known for her sharp tongue, was charged with violation of the Emergency Decree and committing a shameful act by indecently exposing her person under Section 388 of the Thai Criminal Code. The charges result from a protest on 28 September 2021 at the Nang Loeng intersection demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha, during which Worawan took off her clothes, laid down on the ground, and opened her legs in front of a line of crowd control police in protest at their use of violence to disperse protests.

Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR) reported that on Monday (13 March), the Dusit District Court found Worawan guilty of both charges, fining her 30,000 baht for violating the Emergency Decree and 4000 baht for public nudity.

During witness examination, Worawan testified that she was not an organizer of the protest, that she was there as a vendor and was a peaceful participant, and that the protest site was an open and well-ventilated area. She said that her stripping was a symbolic act of protest to prevent crowd control police from arresting protesters and therefore not shameful.

Nevertheless, the court found her guilty on the grounds that the protest was at risk of spreading Covid-19 as the area was crowded and traffic was blocked by protesters, who were not social distancing. It also ruled that she is guilty of indecent exposure because her stripping was a sexually inappropriate action, did not lead to solutions for the protesters’ demands, and did not encourage the exercise of democratic rights and freedom.

In Prachatai’s 2021 Person of the Year interview, Worawan said she was not embarrassed by being naked, and that she wanted to distract the police from arresting or assaulting protesters out of concern that they would be hurt. She also told reporters, after she was summoned to Nang Loeng Police Station to hear the charges, that her action represents the fight of people who have nothing but their bodies to fight against the crowd control police trying to disperse their protests.",Freedom of assembly

At around 2 p.m. on Sunday, March 12, police in Uttar Pradesh arrested Rana, a 19-year-old reporter for the privately owned newspaper Moradabad Ujala, from his home in the Budh Nagar Khandwa village of Sambhal district, according to multiple news reports and the journalist, who spoke with CPJ by phone.

He was released on bail Monday evening, according to those sources.

The Chandausi police station in Sambhal filed a first information report dated March 12, which opened a criminal investigation into the journalist on the basis of a complaint by Shubham Raghav, a local leader of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s youth wing, who alleged that Rana was “fake journalist,” disrupted government work, and assaulted and threatened him at a political event in Budh Nagar Khandwa on March 11.

Rana denied all wrongdoing and said that the arrest and investigation were launched in retaliation for his work. Raghav told CPJ by phone that he stood by the allegations in his complaint.

“The arrest and investigation of journalist Sanjay Rana appear to be retaliatory measures aimed at silencing his critical questioning of a state official,” said Beh Lih Yi, CPJ’s Asia program coordinator. “Authorities must immediately drop any investigation brought against Rana in retaliation for his work and ensure that journalists can work without fear of reprisal.”

The first information report says that Rana is under investigation for violating sections of the penal code pertaining to voluntarily causing hurt, intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace, and criminal intimidation.

At that March 11 event, Rana questioned Gulab Devi, a BJP member in the Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly and state minister for secondary education, about her alleged failure to deliver on her electoral promises regarding development projects in Budh Nagar Khandwa. The journalist told CPJ that he believed the case was retaliation for those questions.

During his arrest, officers grabbed Rana by the collar, slapped him, and tied his hands with a rope, the journalist told CPJ. He was originally held in the Baniyakhed police station, outside the jurisdiction where he lives.

Rana’s editor and lawyer, Dharmendra Singh, told CPJ in a phone interview that he and Rana’s family spent Sunday night frantically searching for the journalist before he was transferred to Chandausi police station the next morning.

Police arrested Rana under a clause of the criminal procedure code allowing for authorities to conduct arrests without a warrant in the cases of more serious crimes, known as cognizable offenses; however, the offenses listed in the first information report concerning his case are all non-cognizable, according to those news reports and a Delhi-based lawyer familiar with the case, who spoke with CPJ on the condition of anonymity due to fear of reprisal.

She was arrested after visiting Lee in jail, iCable said. Tang is understood to have moved to the UK in 2021.

Police confirmed on Thursday night that a 65-year-old woman had been arrested for “suspected collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security.”

Tang was chief executive of the pro-democracy Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU) until 2011, according to her LinkedIn page. The group was among the dozens that disbanded in the wake of the national security law imposed by Beijing in June 2020.

She is currently the general secretary of the International Domestic Workers Federation, a global organisation advocating for the rights of domestic workers with affiliates in 68 countries, according to the group’s website.

HKFP has reached out to the police for comment.
Ex-lawmaker husband

Her husband Lee, a former leader of the Tiananmen vigil organiser the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, is currently detained under the national security law. He and two other ex-leaders, Chow Hang-tung and Albert Ho, and the group itself, stand accused of incitement to subversion.

The case was transferred to the High Court in September, where the highest penalty for incitement to subversion is 10 years’ imprisonment.

Lee was denied bail in December, when a judge ruled there were insufficient grounds for believing that he would not continue to commit acts endangering national security if bail was granted.

In June 2020, Beijing inserted national security legislation directly into Hong Kong’s mini-constitution – bypassing the local legislature – following a year of pro-democracy protests and unrest. It criminalised subversion, secession, collusion with foreign forces and terrorist acts, which were broadly defined to include disruption to transport and other infrastructure. The move gave police sweeping new powers, alarming democrats, civil society groups and trade partners, as such laws have been used broadly to silence and punish dissidents in China. However, the authorities say it has restored stability and peace to the city.
‘Getting off scot-free’

Tang was the target of reports by Beijing-controlled local media outlet Ta Kung Pao in September 2021, when the newspaper accused her of receiving funding from foreign organisations as a board member of labour rights advocacy group Asia Monitor Resource Centre.

Ta Kung Pao added that the centre operated “under” HKCTU, which pro-Beijing supporters have long accused of having close ties with overseas organisations.

After Ta Kung Pao’s report, the centre said it was “independent of any local or international organisations” and said it would cease operations in Hong Kong amid pressure that had “intensified significantly.”

The Asia Monitor Resource Centre conducts advocacy work across the continent. Its website still lists its Hong Kong address.

In November 2021, pro-Beijing supporters petitioned outside the police headquarters, asking why Tang was allowed to “get off scot-free” after Lee had already been “brought to justice.”

Tang’s reported arrest comes days after Chief Executive John Lee met with director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office Xia Baolong in Beijing. Lee said Xia told the leader that the Hong Kong government must “nip in the bud” any acts that endanger national security.

“We will definitely crack down on any [forces] trying to undermine national security or breach the peace of Hong Kong society, or [hurt] Hong Kong’s overall interests – and hold them legally responsible under the law,” Lee, who was in the nation’s capital to attend the start of the National People’s Congress session, said on Monday.",Right to liberty and security

The monk was defrocked and released on the evening of 10 March, and consequently forced back into civilian life.

The arrest occurred during Venerable Soy Sat’s ongoing religious march, which started on 1 March 2023 in the capital and was set to end roughly 350 kilometres away in the border city of Poipet.

Venerable Soy Sat marched to highlight seven demands, including calling for monks who join social actions to not be expelled from pagodas; for courts to not be improperly used against activists; for respect for all citizens’ freedom of expression; for the fair resolution of land conflicts; and for the release of politicians, civil society members, and youths currently detained in prison.

The arrest in Battambang followed an earlier disruption on 7 March 2023, when authorities from neighbouring Pursat province briefly stopped the activist monk and questioned him.

This is the second time this year that Venerable Soy Sat took part in a national march across multiple provinces. In late January, the monk joined a march headed by then-union leader Rong Chhun, who is now a Vice President of the Candlelight Party. Upon returning to his home in Plaoch pagoda in Kampong Speu, Venerable Soy Sat was told he could no longer reside there. He has been living in a nearby forested area since.",Freedom of assembly

114,Thailand,Thailand: two more pro-democracy demonstrators arrested,19/03/2023,"Two protesters arrested on Thursday (9 March) and charged with royal defamation and contempt of court for singing and speaking at a protest in July 2022 have been denied bail.

Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR) reported that Chen Chiwabancha, a 55-year-old YouTuber, was arrested at around 16.00 on Thursday (9 March) while at a protest in front of the Ratchadapisek Criminal Court. He was arrested on a warrant from the South Bangkok Criminal Court on charges of royal defamation, contempt of court, defamation by publication, and using a sound amplifier without permission. TLHR noted that he had never received a summons before being arrested.

While Chen was detained at Yannawa Police Station, at around 18.25, police also arrested Ngoentra Khamsaen, a regular protest-goer also known as Mani, who went to Yannawa Police Station after Chen was arrested. She faced the same charges as Chen, and also had never received a summons before being arrested.

TLHR reported that the charges result from a protest on 28 July 2022 in front of the South Bangkok Criminal Court, and that they were filed by the Court of Justice. The police claimed that the protesters gave speeches without requesting permission to use a sound amplifier and put up banners insulting the court. They also sang a song called “Lucky to have Thai people,” which the police claimed insults the monarchy.

The song was written by the protest band Faiyen, known for writing songs critical of the monarchy. Members of the band have been charged with royal defamation and fled the country after the 2014 coup.

“Lucky to have Thai people” [link blocked in Thaiand] is a song about how Thai people are made to love the King through many means and the punishment the people will face if they do not love the King.

Another protester has previously been arrested for singing the song during a protest in August 2022. TLHR also reported 4 other cases in which someone has been charged with royal defamation for singing or playing the song. In all 5 cases, the accused was granted bail.

Chen and Ngoentra were detained overnight at Yannawa Police Station. They were taken to the South Bangkok Criminal Court the following morning for a temporary detention request and were denied bail. The court claimed that the charges carry a high penalty and that they are likely to flee or commit other dangerous offence. The order was signed by judge Phaibun Thongnuam.

115,Indonesia,Indonesia: Journalist beaten by police for reporting,25/04/2023,"Cases of abuse against members of the press occurred again at the Keerom District Government office, Papua Province, on Thursday 09/03/2023, around 14:00 WIT.

This abuse occurred in the office area of ​​the Keerom Regency Border Area Management and Cooperation Agency, while carrying out his journalistic duties in the online media globalinvestigation.com, whose initials ""N"" were beaten by security officers (Police).

According to the victim's statement, the chronology of the incident of persecution allegedly occurred because of previously published reports regarding the beating of a member of the public against a Satpol PP officer who was on duty in the Deputy Regent's and Keerom Regional Secretary rooms.

Moments later, the police officer (perpetrator) came out of his room and looked for the victim (journalist) then shouted loudly reprimanding and hitting the victim while he was standing near the betel nut seller, next to the Border Area Management Agency office. The victim saw a security guard (police) with several of his colleagues walking quickly up to him, then the security officer (police) said

""I just got the news that was shared. Why bring down the Keerom Government?” he said.

Then the security guard (police) punched the victim, and the victim only tried to dodge and block the blows, but several punches were made to the victim's face resulting in bruises.

Then from that, the victim ran into the room of the secretary of the Border Agency office to save himself, but the security guard (police) continued to chase the victim and the victim fell down, then was beaten again by him "".

""When the victim was hit, it was suspected that there was a tone of threat to shoot the victim with a gun,"" said the person loudly to the victim ""Don't you know me? person against the victim"".

After that, the victim told the unscrupulous person that the news did not bring down the Keerom District Government.

The victim made this report spontaneously when an incident occurred when a member of the public beat a Satpol PP officer, besides the victim was not far from the TKP.

JLW, when confirmed by the media crew, confirmed that the victim's family had made a Police Report (LP) and a post mortem et repertum was being carried out at the Kwaingga Keerom Hospital.

He conveyed that he, as a family, deeply regretted the unethical behavior of unscrupulous members in the persecution of his younger sibling.

He asked that unscrupulous members be dealt with strictly according to applicable law and investigators must also apply the rules of the Press Law because at the time of the incident the victim was a journalist carrying out his journalistic duties. This has hindered his work as a journalist and the perpetrators must also be charged under Article 18 of the Press Law No. 40 of 1999 which carries a penalty of 2 years in prison or a fine of Rp. 500 million.

116,India,India: Online harassment of Dalit writer and activist,28/03/2023,"The Network of Women in Media, India (NWMI) issued a statement on Monday condemning the online harassment of Dalit writer and activist Shalin Maria Lawrence. ""Shalin has been facing high-volume targeted harassment on Twitter as well as Facebook over the past year, specifically from handles associated with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),"" says the NWMI statement. 

The statement describes the degree of harassment and trolling faced by Shalin who raises awareness about caste-related atrocities in Tamil Nadu on social media. ""However, rather than engaging in introspection or at least combating her with facts, figures, or ideas, they have taken to coordinated attacks, bombarding her with demeaning language including casteist slurs, body shaming her, slurs based on her religion, and making scurrilous charges against her character and integrity. They have also targeted her close family members,"" the statement says. 

""Shalin’s refusal to be silenced comes at a great cost to her physical and mental health,"" the statement says, going on to add: ""The toll of such violence on the mental health of women journalists cannot be calculated. Many women journalists engage in self-censorship to avoid being subjected to such assaults online. The result is only a weaker democracy in which views that could be valuable are silenced."" 

In light of the NWMI's statement, journalists and activists have taken to social media to express solidarity with Shalin.

""I've followed Shalin on Twitter & the only time I heard her speak at a meeting I was moved by her passion. Political discourse on social media is reaching absurdly new levels on misogyny. Abusing someone for calling out atrocities shows the extent of rot,"" tweeted Tamil writer and activist Meena Kandasamy.

Journalist Dhanya Rajendran along with singers Chinmayi and TM Krishna also tweeted in support of Shalin.

Shalin is a Tamil writer and activist, author of 'Sandaikaarigal' and 'Vadachennaikari', and an active voice in the anti-caste and gender quality discourse in Tamil Nadu.

""The DMK's IT wing and bots are continuously abusing and trolling me. This is crossing all limits. I feel like quitting everything. The emotional torture is unbearable and cruel. This is life-threatening,"" Shalin said in a recent tweet. Shalin had also tweeted on March 9 about the turmoil she is undergoing because of the continuous online harassment. The writer had tagged the Twitter handles of the Tamil Nadu Police and the Tamil Nadu Chief Minster.

The NWMI statement also says that Shalin is not the only one being targeted this way. ""A global survey by the International Centre for Journalists and UNESCO in 2020 found that nearly three out of four women journalists had experienced online violence,"" it says, demanding that the leaders of the parties tell their supporters and cadres to stop harassment against Shalin and other women.

118,Pakistan,Pakistan: social media activist goes missing,19/03/2023,"Abid Mir, a human rights activist and journalist from Balochistan, has gone missing from Islamabad.

According to his family, he disappeared after going to an ATM on Wednesday evening. Mir, who is known for his social media activism and his work on human rights in Balochistan, was last seen at the Baloch Aurat March, which took place on Wednesday.

Mir's brother Khalid Mir released a video on Twitter in which he stated that the family is in contact with the police to register a missing-persons FIR. He further stated that Mir had not been involved in any controversial issues lately, and he did not have any specific threat from anybody.

Islamabad police however announced later on Thursday night that Mir had returned home.

In a tweet, the capital police said that the impression of Abid going missing was false and had been created after the journalist lost contact with his family.

The Islamabad police thanked all the citizens and journalists who contacted the force regarding Abid Mir's disappearance.

The disappearance of the Baloch activist has raised grave concerns on social media. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has also expressed concern and urged the Islamabad Police to investigate the matter immediately.

Many journalists and social media activists have voiced their concern over Mir’s missing, including journalist Hamid Mir.

Mir worked as a regional editor for Lok Sujag – a multimedia investigative journalism platform that focuses on issues and communities marginalised in the mainstream media and policy discourse.

The disappearance of Abid Mir has brought attention to the increasing number of missing persons cases in Pakistan. Former Punjab chief minister Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi has claimed that the number of cases has increased during the tenure of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

The disappearance of Abid Mir is a matter of great concern, and it is essential that the authorities take immediate action to ensure his safe return.

120,Pakistan,"Pakistan: defenders joining International Women’s Day lathi-charged, obstructed",19/03/2023,"The Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (FORUM-ASIA) and seven of its member organisations condemn police violence against peaceful Aurat March protesters in Pakistan on International Women’s Day.

Since 2018, the Aurat March has been organized annually by feminist organisations to bring to attention the socio-political problems and violence faced by women and gender minorities as a result of the country’s patriarchal practices. The Aurat March has continuously faced significant backlash from both State and non-State actors.

“Over the years, Aurat March has become a vital platform for gender rights activism in Pakistan. It has brought attention to the systemic patriarchal discrimination and violence that women and gender minorities in Pakistan continue to face daily. It is a powerful call for equality and justice. We unequivocally support Aurat March’s commitment towards a gender-just Pakistan. We condemn the use of force against peaceful protesters,” said the rights groups.

This year, the Aurat March faced immense challenges. In Lahore, the district administration did not permit organisers to hold the event citing Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Section 144 is a colonial-era law used to crush dissent that prohibits all sorts of assemblies, including sit-ins, rallies, processions, demonstrations, and protests.

Meanwhile, in Islamabad, the police baton-charged participants. Protesters were also confronted with barbed wires and containers on their march route, alongside a heavy police deployment.

Since 2018, the Aurat March has been organized annually by feminist organisations to bring to attention the socio-political problems and violence faced by women and gender minorities as a result of the country’s patriarchal practices. The Aurat March has continuously faced significant backlash from both State and non-State actors.

“Over the years, Aurat March has become a vital platform for gender rights activism in Pakistan. It has brought attention to the systemic patriarchal discrimination and violence that women and gender minorities in Pakistan continue to face daily. It is a powerful call for equality and justice. We unequivocally support Aurat March’s commitment towards a gender-just Pakistan. We condemn the use of force against peaceful protesters,” said the rights groups.

This year, the Aurat March faced immense challenges. In Lahore, the district administration did not permit organisers to hold the event citing Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Section 144 is a colonial-era law used to crush dissent that prohibits all sorts of assemblies, including sit-ins, rallies, processions, demonstrations, and protests.

121,China,China: pro-democracy couple prevented from leaving home,19/03/2023,"State security police surrounded the home of rights activist Li Wenzu and her rights lawyer husband Wang Quanzhang on International Women’s Day, as a U.S.-based rights group hit out at the country's intimidation and harassment of dissidents.

“They sent people to start blocking our door, and not allowing us to go out, from about 5 a.m.,” Wang said from the couple’s home in Beijing’s Shunyi district on Thursday. “They used open umbrellas and shone their flashlights at our security cameras to stop themselves being captured.”

“Our camera shot some blurry footage of them, and found out later that they’d stuck some kind of medicinal plaster over the lens,” he said.

But the harassment didn't stop there, said Wang, a prominent target of a nationwide police operation that detained hundreds of rights lawyers, law firm staff and activists starting on July 9, 2015, and who later sued the authorities over his treatment in detention.

“At around 7:30 a.m., they started knocking on the door,” he said, adding that when he had opened the door to speak with them, they said they were there due to “special circumstances,” as it was International Women’s Day.

“There were around 20 of them, front and back, with several of their vehicles parked outside the door,” said Wang, who also found that the tires of his car were flat on the same day.

“This happened on Human Rights Day last year too, so I’m even more sure that someone is doing this stuff deliberately,” he said. “Other lawyers [in my chat group] told me they had also found their tires punctured.”

Passport application denied

The harassment of Wang and his family comes as the ruling Chinese Communist Party steps up “stability maintenance” measures during the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress in Beijing.

But fellow rights activist Wang Qiaoling said she believes the harassment could be linked to the fact that Li, who won the Franco-German Prize for Human Rights and the Rule of Law in 2019, had planned to file an administrative review against her denied application for a passport, to mark International Women's Day.

“We were planning to go to the Beijing municipal government to submit an application for an administrative review [of that decision], which is actually a pretty common legal procedure,” Wang Qiaoling said. “I don’t understand why they had to go to such lengths [to stop it].”

As the state security police stood guard over Wang and Li, a report from the U.S.-based think tank Freedom House showed that China remains at the bottom of its global survey of freedoms, one of the few countries to have been described as ""Not free"" for five consecutive decades.

“China ranks near the absolute bottom in terms of overall political rights and civil liberties,” according to the “Freedom in the World 2023” report, which described the country as unmatched in its ability to deploy technology in the service of a surveillance state. “Those who criticized the party received severe penalties.”

It said no country could match the scale and sophistication of the Chinese surveillance state.

“Residents’ activities are invasively monitored by public security cameras, urban grid managers, and automated systems that detect suspicious and banned behavior, including innocuous expressions of ethnic and religious identity,” the report said. 

“Those identified as dissidents can face consequences including forced disappearance and torture,” it said. “Protesters continued to encounter pervasive surveillance, abusive interrogations, and intimidation at the hands of authorities.”

Zhou Fengsuo, executive director of the U.S.-based rights group Human Rights in China, said there is still plenty of resistance to abuses of power by the government, citing the white paper movement of November 2022 that prompted a swift retreat from the rolling lockdowns, mass quarantine and compulsory testing of supreme leader Xi Jinping’s zero-COVID policy.

“On the one hand, the Chinese Communist Party stepped up controls and concentrated its power, and its darkness reached a peak,” Zhou said. 

“But on the other hand, there was also unprecedented resistance to trouble the waters, particularly in the second half of the year,” he said. “Eventually, that culminated in the white paper movement of late November.”",Freedom of movement

125,Kyrgyzstan,Kyrgyzstan: court uphold decision to block independent media outlet (Update),19/03/2023,"A court in Kyrgyzstan has upheld a decision of the Ministry of Culture, Information, Sports, and Youth Policies to block the websites of RFE/RL's Kyrgyz Service, known locally as Radio Azattyk, after the broadcaster refused to remove a report on a border dispute with neighboring Tajikistan.

The ruling by Bishkek's Administrative Court was announced on March 7 at an appeal hearing launched by RFE/RL that sought to have the October move to block the sites overturned. The court did not explain the reasoning behind its ruling.

RFE/RL's lawyers said they will appeal the court decision.

Representatives of the Ministry of Culture, Information, Sports, and Youth Policies reiterated at the hearing that their decision was made due to RFE/RL's refusal to remove from its websites a video about deadly clashes along a disputed segment of the Kyrgyz-Tajik border in September, again emphasizing that the video took the position of the Tajik side.

The video in question was produced by Current Time, the Russian-language network run by RFE/RL in cooperation with Voice of America.

RFE/RL President and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Fly said the broadcaster ""takes our commitment to balanced reporting seriously"" and that after a review of the content in question, ""no violation of our standards"" was found.

125,Kyrgyzstan,Kyrgyzstan: court uphold decision to block independent media outlet (Update),19/03/2023,"A court in Kyrgyzstan has upheld a decision of the Ministry of Culture, Information, Sports, and Youth Policies to block the websites of RFE/RL's Kyrgyz Service, known locally as Radio Azattyk, after the broadcaster refused to remove a report on a border dispute with neighboring Tajikistan.

The ruling by Bishkek's Administrative Court was announced on March 7 at an appeal hearing launched by RFE/RL that sought to have the October move to block the sites overturned. The court did not explain the reasoning behind its ruling.

RFE/RL's lawyers said they will appeal the court decision.

Representatives of the Ministry of Culture, Information, Sports, and Youth Policies reiterated at the hearing that their decision was made due to RFE/RL's refusal to remove from its websites a video about deadly clashes along a disputed segment of the Kyrgyz-Tajik border in September, again emphasizing that the video took the position of the Tajik side.

The video in question was produced by Current Time, the Russian-language network run by RFE/RL in cooperation with Voice of America.

RFE/RL President and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Fly said the broadcaster ""takes our commitment to balanced reporting seriously"" and that after a review of the content in question, ""no violation of our standards"" was found.

126,Viet Nam,Viet Nam: lawyers accused following investigation (Update),18/03/2023,"Vietnamese police have summoned two attorneys defending members of a Buddhist house church in Long An province, accusing them of violating a law that is widely used to imprison dissidents.

Attorneys Dang Dinh Manh and Dao Kim Lan, two of five defense lawyers working on a case involving the Peng Lei Buddhist Church are accused of “abusing democratic freedoms to infringe on the interests of the state” under Article 331 of Vietnam’s Penal Code.

Vietnamese authorities routinely use the statute to attack those speaking out in defense of human rights.

Freedom of religion is technically enshrined in Vietnam’s constitution, but it also allows authorities to override rights, including religious freedom, for purposes of national security, social order, social morality and community well-being. Authorities have been aggressive in crushing various religious groups.

The one-party Vietnamese government also is notorious for violations of human rights, including the prosecuting of rights attorneys and other defenders, and ignoring international obligations to promote and protect them. 

According to the notices, police summoned the lawyers after the Department of Cybersecurity and High-Tech Crime Prevention under Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security issued an advisory that some of the defense attorneys involved in the case showed signs of violating Article 331. 

The summons for Dang Dinh Manh, dated March 6, instructed him to meet with police investigators on March 21, 2023, while the summons for Dao Kim Lan, dated March 8, told him to meet with them on March 15. 

Many state-media outlets, including Tien Phong, or The Pioneers, and Phap Luat TPHCM, or the Ho Chi Minh City Law Newspaper, reported that police were investigating the two lawyers.

In February, three lawyers — Dang Dinh Manh, Dao Kim Lan and Ngo Thi Hoang Anh — were notified by Long An police that they had “carried out activities of disseminating videos, images, statements and stories with signs of abusing the rights to freedom and democracy to violate the state’s interests and legitimate rights and interests of individuals and organizations,” according to state media reports.

RFA could not reach Ngo Thi Hoang Anh to confirm that she had received a summons. Dang Dinh Manh and Dao Kim Lan refused to comment. 

‘Abusing democratic freedoms’

The three lawyers and two others — Nguyen Van Mieng and Trinh Vinh Phuc — have been providing legal support for six members of the house church, who in July 2022 were sentenced to a combined 23 years and six months in prison on charges of “abusing democratic freedoms” under Article 331.

Duc Hoa district police and Venerable Thich Nhat Tu, a Buddhist monk, were the plaintiffs in the case. 

Before the first-instance trial, lawyers sent an 11-page petition to Vietnam’s president and the heads of the National Assembly, Ministry of Public Security, and People’s Supreme Procuracy, highlighting indications of the violation of criminal procedures and judicial activities. 

The lawyers also raised concern about the objectivity of the investigation because Duc Hoa district police, a plaintiff, was part of the probe. 

The petition also indicated that police forced a Peng Lei nun to submit to a gynecological examination, offending her honor and dignity because the action was unrelated to the case. 

Even though the lawyers’ complaints had not been addressed, the Duc Hoa People’s Court moved ahead, putting the six church members on trial and sentencing them each to three to five years in prison. 

Police investigator Huynh Hung, who is in charge of the case against the lawyers, declined to answer Radio Free Asia’s questions about the case. 

Attorney Nguyen Van Dai, who now lives in Germany, told RFA on Monday that the responsible agencies should have quickly responded to the petition filed by the church’s lawyers instead of launching an investigation against them. 

“This was a serious violation of freedom of speech and press freedom of lawyers in general and citizens in general,” he said. “They [the authorities] used available tools, including the police and the procuracy, to dismiss the lawyers from their profession. This was an act of vindictiveness by the authorities towards human rights lawyers.”",Right to work

128,Afghanistan,Afghanistan: WHRD arrested in Ghor Province,25/04/2023,"Ghor Civil Society Network has called on the Taliban to release human rights activist Habiba Sharifi who was arrested after protesting outside the provincial governor’s office on Wednesday.

In a statement released on Thursday, the organization said that Habiba raised her voice for human rights and women’s rights, and that she had not committed a crime but had been arrested and imprisoned.

The network called on the Taliban to “tolerate” peaceful protests by Afghan women and stated they have a right to get an education and to work based on Islamic law.

The organization also called on the international community to step in and make the Taliban release Habiba and her father, who they also arrested.

Habiba Sharifi on Wednesday, on the occasion of International Women’s Day (March 8), protested alone in front of the Taliban governor’s office in Ghor and held a poster with a slogan demanding education, work, and social justice for women.

The Taliban, however, arrested Habiba and her father later that day at their home.

According to sources, the Taliban are holding Habiba in Firozkoh prison and her father is being held at the group’s intelligence directorate.

The U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, said in his latest report this week that the situation in Afghanistan has significantly deteriorated and the Taliban are systematically and intentionally erasing Afghan women from public life.

The Taliban has not commented on the detention of Habiba Sharifi so far.

129,China,China: Hong Kong WHRD and lawyer faces further judicial harassment (Update),19/03/2023,"

On 4 March 2023, a Hong Kong government-designated national security judge at the West Kowloon Magistrates’ Court convicted woman human rights defender Chow Hang-tung and two other leaders of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China (the Hong Kong Alliance) for refusing to comply with the Hong Kong police’s request in August 2021 demanding disclosure of extensive information about its funding, activities, Board members, executives, and staff.

Sentencing is scheduled on 11 March 2023. The woman human rights defender and the two other Alliance leaders face up to six months in jail and a HKD100,000 fine (approximately EUR 11,919). Chow Hang-tung is also being prosecuted for “inciting subversion of State power” under the National Security Law in a separate case.

The police’s request for information was based on what it claimed were “reasonable grounds” for believing the Alliance was a “foreign agent”, and was issued under the Implementation Rules for Article 43 of the National Security Law in Hong Kong, which grant expansive investigative powers to the police. However, during the trial, the prosecution concealed the identity of the foreign organisation for which it accused the Alliance of acting as a “foreign agent”, and a key police officer who testified also refused to answer questions regarding the identity of the foreign organisation. The judge also sided with the prosecution’s and the police’s argument that disclosure of such information would damage “the public interest” and “jeopardise on-going investigations” into other individuals and organisations.

Chow Hang-tung (鄒幸彤) is a barrister and woman human rights defender in Hong Kong. At the time of her arrest on 8 September 2021 for refusing to provide data to the police, she was one of the vice-chairs of the Hong Kong Alliance. On 24 September 2021, as a result of the prosecution of the Alliance’s leaders and high risks of further prosecution, members of the Alliance voted to dissolve the organisation. On 26 October 2021, while the liquidation process for the Alliance was still on-going, then Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam issued an order for the Alliance be removed from the Companies Register on the basis that ""the operation of the Alliance which seeks to end the Chinese Communist Party's leadership amounts to seeking to overthrow"" the political system of the People's Republic of China and subverting state power.”

In his ruling, the national security judge also affirmed that the National Security Law itself as well as the decisions and actions of the National Security Committee, a new body created under the National Security Law, cannot be challenged in local court. The National S ecurity Committee, chaired by Hong Kong’s chief executive and supervised by the central Chinese government in Beijing, was responsible for developing the Implementation Rules for Article 43 of the National Security Law.

UN human rights experts have repeatedly raised concerns that the National Security Law and its Implementation Rules for Article 43 pose serious risks to the right to defend human rights and to freedom of expression, freedom of association, privacy, and a fair trial.

In September 2021, UN Special Procedures mandate-holders wrote to the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities about the detention of Chow Hang-tung. The experts said that detention and arrests of human rights defenders “form part of a broader operation to impose undue restrictions on the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly of pro-democracy movements in Hong Kong” and that such “a criminalisation of the exercise of human rights with reference to national security is incompatible with international human rights law.”

In July 2022, the UN Human Rights Committee, in its concluding observations on the implementation by the Hong Kong government of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), expressed concerns about the arbitrary arrests and detention of human rights defenders under the National Security Law and sedition law, calling for the suspension of enforcement of these laws and for their reform or repeal. The Committee stated that “Article 43(6) of the National Security Law and Schedule 6 of the Implementation Rules, which facilitate arbitrary intrusion into privacy for the purpose of public security or national security, are not compatible with article 17 of the Covenant.”

In February 2023, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also criticised the use of the National Security Law to target human rights defenders in Hong Kong, and was concerned that the law “has de facto abolished the independence of the judiciary.” It has called for a review of the Law to bring it into line with international human rights standards.

Front Line Defenders believes the arrest and subsequent prosecution of Chow Hang-tung and other Alliance members under the National Security Law are reprisals against their legitimate and peaceful human rights work. Both the substantive and procedural inconsistencies with international human rights standards seen in this case illustrate the intention and capacity of the Hong Kong authorities to use the National Security Law and its Implementation Rules to punish and intimidate human rights defenders and organisations and deter them from communicating or collaborating with or receiving support from international partners, other governments, and UN human rights mechanisms.

Front Line Defenders calls on the Hong Kong authorities to quash the conviction against Chow Hang-tung and the other Alliance leaders, release them immediately, and drop the other criminal charges against them. It reiterates its call on the central Chinese government to repeal the National Security Law and its Implementation Rules in Hong Kong.

130,Viet Nam,"Vietnam: social media activist denied family, lawyer visit (Update)",18/03/2023,"Vietnamese authorities have barred relatives and legal counsel from meeting with a detained Facebook user under investigation for posting “illegal content,” prompting criticism from an international rights group, which called the move “a clear rights violation.”

Late last month, police in southern Vietnam’s Can Tho city arrested activist Le Minh The, 60, for posts on his Facebook page they allege were in violation of a vaguely worded law routinely used to suppress independent bloggers and journalists.

The was charged with “abusing the rights to freedom and democracy to violate the State’s interests and legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals” under Article 331, state media reported at the time. 

On Friday, The’s younger sister, Le Thi Binh, told RFA Vietnamese that guards at the Long Tuyen Detention Center had refused her family the right to see him, although they agreed to let them deposit money for him to buy food and other necessities, as well as deliver him some meals.

“On [Wednesday], I went to the detention center to see my brother The and send him some food,” she said. “However, the detention center’s staff said I could not see him while he is under investigation. I called the investigation team, but they did not answer.”

Binh, who completed a two-year jail term on the same charge in late 2022, said that the Binh Thuy District Police had yet to provide her family with any documents related to The’s arrest, including a report detailing a search of their home on Feb. 22.

RFA called Officer Ky, who is investigating The’s case, but he refused to confirm Binh’s claims and referred further inquiries to the Binh Thuy Police Department. A staff member at the Binh Thuy Police Department told RFA that a reporter would have to meet with senior officers in person for any information about the case.

State media reports detailing The’s arrest claimed he had posted “illegal content” on Facebook, but did not specify what post had violated the law. The last post on The’s Facebook account concerned U.S. President Joe Biden’s visit to Ukraine on Feb. 21, while other posts included content about Vietnam, a police summons for his sister, information about homegrown electric car maker VinFast, and a recent RFA article about a fortune teller-turned-priest.

“Looking at his livestreams and other content [on Facebook], I didn’t see anything against the State,” Binh told RFA, noting that most of the articles he shared were published by state media.

“He talked about some corrupt government officials who had already been arrested. He also livestreamed a video about polluted wastewater in his neighborhood.”

Prior sentence on same charges

The charges facing The are the same ones he was sentenced to two years in prison for in March 2019. He completed his jail term in July 2020, accounting for time spent in detention prior to his conviction.

Both The and his sister were refused visits from their families while they were under investigation for their earlier charges – a policy Hanoi Bar Association lawyer Ha Huy Son told RFA is only applicable to people accused of committing “offenses against national security,” which they were not.

Phil Robertson, deputy director for Human Rights Watch’s Asia division, said there is “no acceptable reason” for authorities to prevent legal counsel and relatives from visiting The.

“Every time the authorities commit such a clear rights violation, it undermines Hanoi's claims to be providing free and fair trials to those it prosecutes in court,” he said in an emailed statement to RFA. “What's clear is that the police believe they enjoy impunity to do whatever they want, and that laws do not necessarily apply to them.""

Robertson said the fact that The was arrested for expressing his opinions on his Facebook page demonstrates the Vietnamese government’s intolerance of dissent.

“Although freedom of speech is a universal human right and should not be criminalized, in Vietnam the authorities often harass, intimidate, and arrest anyone speaking up against government policy,” he said.

Anticipating another significant jail term for The, Robertson called on the international community to take action. “Foreign diplomats should be demanding that Hanoi stop these kinds of arrests, and immediately and unconditionally release Le Minh The,” he said.",Right to fair trial

131,Pakistan,Pakistan: International Women’s Day march denied,06/03/2023,"Deputy Commissioner (DC) Rafia Haider has rejected permission to organise the Aurat March on the grounds of security concerns, ‘controversial’ cards and banners supporting women’s rights, and the likelihood of clashes with members of Jamaat-i-Islami’s ‘Haya March’.

Civil society, political parties, and rights organisations condemned the deputy commissioner for rejecting the plea to organise Aurat March on International Women’s Day on March 8.

The Aurat March organizing committee had requested a no objection certificate (NOC) from the district administration to hold a rally on March 8 at Nasser Bagh, Lahore, followed by a march around the perimeter of the park.

However, DC Haider rejected the plea in the wake of threat alerts from security agencies.

“Following the current security scenario, threat alerts, and law and order situation, and in light of activities like controversial cards and banners for awareness of women’s rights and the strong reservation of the general public and religious organizations, especially JI’s women’s and student wings, who had also announced a program against the Aurat March,” said a statement issued by the DC.
There is fear of conflict between the two groups, therefore, the NOC may not be issued for the holding of the Aurat March and Convention at Alhamra Hall, The Mall, and Aiwan-i-Iqbal, and a rally from the Lahore Press Club to Charing Cross, and also at a rally at Nasser Bagh, on March 8 to avoid any law and order situation or mishap.

The Aurat March organising committee strongly condemned the DC for rejecting their application to hold the event. “Women, khawaja sara community, transgender persons, gender non-conforming people, and allies of the Aurat March have the right to the assembly under Article 16 of the Constitution of Pakistan,” they said.

They said that the DC denied the NOC under the pressure of the JI’s “Haya March.”

They said the denial to hold Aurat March was against their constitutional right, and the DC did not take action against the group for inciting violence against them.

They said they were denied permission to gather at Nasser Bagh and other avenues, such as the Lahore Press Club, Alhamra, and The Mall. “We do not require an NOC to exercise our constitutional right to march. There is no legitimate “public order” rationale to prevent us from assembling, marching and making our voices heard,” reads the statement.

They added the administration has forgotten that the courts have already upheld their right to hold Aurat March in 2020. “Lahore and Islamabad high courts upheld the march’s constitutional right to speech and assembly and directed the government to grant permission to carry out the march,” the committee said.

They said they would hold the march on March 8 and would not allow anyone to snatch their constitutional right.

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan also strongly condemned the Lahore district administration for rejecting Aurat March organisers permission to hold a public rally marking International Women’s Day on March 8.

“It is regrettable that their right to peaceful assembly is routinely challenged by the district administration because ‘controversial’ placards and ‘strong reservations’ from the public and religious organisations ostensibly create law-and-order risks. This is a poor defence.”

The HRCP demanded that the caretaker Punjab government uphold the Aurat March’s right to freedom of peaceful assembly and provide the marchers with full security.

One of the committee members, Hiba, told Dawn that the DC allowed the JI to hold a rally to celebrate their “Haya Day” but refused to permit to hold Aurat March.

132,China,China: women's labor organization compelled to cancel rally in Hong Kong,19/03/2023,"A women's labor organization in Hong Kong canceled a march last weekend to mark International Women’s Day amid threats from police that they would arrest key activists.

The move comes despite the lifting of bans on public gatherings in Hong Kong and criticism by a United Nations rights expert about curbs on civil society and rights activism under a draconian security law.

""We have regretfully decided to cancel the Women's Day rally and demonstration that were scheduled for tomorrow,"" the Hong Kong Women Workers’ Association said in a brief statement on its Facebook account on Saturday, without giving a reason for the change. ""Apologies for this!""

The League of Social Democrats, a pro-democracy political party led by veteran rights activists that would have taken part in the event, said police had claimed that ""violent elements"" had been planning to join the rally.

""We are sure the reasons behind the decision are patently obvious to the public,"" the group said in a statement on its Facebook page, adding: ""Two days before the march, four LSD members were warned by the National Security Police that they must not join the march, or else they will be arrested.""

League Chairperson Chan Po-ying said she and three other members were hauled in by national security police on March 3 and warned that they would be arrested if they took part in the event.

""They called last Friday ... and sent a car to take me to the police station,"" Chan told Radio Free Asia. ""They got straight to the point and told us that we couldn't take part in the demonstration, without giving the reason.""

""They just said that we are well-known figures ... When I asked what would happen if I insisted on going, he told me very clearly that I would be arrested,"" she said. ""He wouldn't answer my questions ... just told me not to go.""

Chan said it's possible that the authorities are trying to avoid any public protest or dissent during the annual session of China's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress in Beijing.

‘Deeply infuriated’

The League of Social Democrats said on Facebook that it was ""deeply infuriated that our joining of a legal protest was met with intimidation and obstruction by the National Security Police,"" it said. 

""Under such pressure, we decided not to attend. Yet we still hoped the march would go ahead, and the flags of gender equality and the rights of women from the grassroots would fly high on the streets.""

It said Hong Kongers' freedom of expression and right to protest were now in ""shreds.""

Human rights experts at the United Nations seemed to agree, issuing a report that was highly critical of human rights protections in Hong Kong following a review of economic, social and cultural rights in Geneva last month.

""The Committee is concerned about reports of arrests, detentions and trials without due process of civil society actors, journalists, human rights defenders, lawyers working on human rights, disbarment of such lawyers, and others working to defend economic, social and cultural rights,"" the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights said in concluding comments following the review process.

It called for a review of a draconian national security law imposed on Hong Kong by the ruling Chinese Communist Party from July 1, 2020, and for a national security hotline taking tip-offs from informers about breaches of the law – which criminalizes criticism of the authorities – to be abolished.

""The Committee ... concerned that the national security hotline is used extensively and might have detrimental effects on the work and expression of civil society, trade unions, teachers and other actors, including those mentioned above, working on human rights,"" it said.

‘Mobs in black’

Hong Kong Chief Executive and former police chief John Lee said the organizers of public events have a legal responsibility to ensure it doesn't break the law.

""Anyone who is not confident, is incompetent, or is worried about whether they can do this should not organize public activities, because they have to bear the legal responsibility,"" he warned.

""We have felt the pain caused to Hong Kong by mobs in black to Hong Kong,"" Lee said, in a reference to the 2019 protest movement that won broad popular support at the time for its calls for fully democratic elections and better official accountability.

Former pro-democracy lawmaker Ted Hui, who fled into exile amid the citywide crackdown that followed the 2019 protests, said police now appear unwilling to allow any kind of political activity in public.

""My analysis is that the police want to ban demonstrations, and they're not going to give them any opportunity,"" Hui said. ""The police didn't reject the application for the demonstration, so next time they go to the United Nations or face [criticism from] Western countries, they can say they approved it, but that the group canceled it.""

""Threatening to arrest people unless they refrain from taking part in a demonstration is very indicative [of the authorities' attitude] and a blatant violation of the Basic Law,"" he said.

Current affairs commentator Sang Pu said Beijing is continuing to manipulate civil society and political participation in Hong Kong, citing the recent cancellation of the Democratic Party's spring fundraiser by the venue, which said it had an issue with its gas supply.

""This is the Chinese Communist Party ... fully implementing the model it uses [to control] the Chinese people in Hong Kong,"" Sang said.

""It's very similar to the methods they used to suppress lawyers caught up in the July 9, 2015 crackdown [on rights attorneys, public interest law firms and rights activists],"" he said.

132,China,China: women's labor organization compelled to cancel rally in Hong Kong,19/03/2023,"A women's labor organization in Hong Kong canceled a march last weekend to mark International Women’s Day amid threats from police that they would arrest key activists.

The move comes despite the lifting of bans on public gatherings in Hong Kong and criticism by a United Nations rights expert about curbs on civil society and rights activism under a draconian security law.

""We have regretfully decided to cancel the Women's Day rally and demonstration that were scheduled for tomorrow,"" the Hong Kong Women Workers’ Association said in a brief statement on its Facebook account on Saturday, without giving a reason for the change. ""Apologies for this!""

The League of Social Democrats, a pro-democracy political party led by veteran rights activists that would have taken part in the event, said police had claimed that ""violent elements"" had been planning to join the rally.

""We are sure the reasons behind the decision are patently obvious to the public,"" the group said in a statement on its Facebook page, adding: ""Two days before the march, four LSD members were warned by the National Security Police that they must not join the march, or else they will be arrested.""

League Chairperson Chan Po-ying said she and three other members were hauled in by national security police on March 3 and warned that they would be arrested if they took part in the event.

""They called last Friday ... and sent a car to take me to the police station,"" Chan told Radio Free Asia. ""They got straight to the point and told us that we couldn't take part in the demonstration, without giving the reason.""

""They just said that we are well-known figures ... When I asked what would happen if I insisted on going, he told me very clearly that I would be arrested,"" she said. ""He wouldn't answer my questions ... just told me not to go.""

Chan said it's possible that the authorities are trying to avoid any public protest or dissent during the annual session of China's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress in Beijing.

‘Deeply infuriated’

The League of Social Democrats said on Facebook that it was ""deeply infuriated that our joining of a legal protest was met with intimidation and obstruction by the National Security Police,"" it said. 

""Under such pressure, we decided not to attend. Yet we still hoped the march would go ahead, and the flags of gender equality and the rights of women from the grassroots would fly high on the streets.""

It said Hong Kongers' freedom of expression and right to protest were now in ""shreds.""

Human rights experts at the United Nations seemed to agree, issuing a report that was highly critical of human rights protections in Hong Kong following a review of economic, social and cultural rights in Geneva last month.

""The Committee is concerned about reports of arrests, detentions and trials without due process of civil society actors, journalists, human rights defenders, lawyers working on human rights, disbarment of such lawyers, and others working to defend economic, social and cultural rights,"" the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights said in concluding comments following the review process.

133,China,"China: lawyer held incommunicado, rights activists under surveillance",06/03/2023,"A human rights lawyer who represented Ai Weiwei against the Chinese government has ""disappeared"" after trying to board a train to the southern province of Guangdong, according to rights activists.

Liu Xiaoyuan was stopped by police on March 1 as he tried to travel to Zhuhai city from Ganzhou in the eastern province of Jiangxi, the Weiquanwang rights website reported.

""I was stopped by police from the Ganzhou West Railway Station public security station in Jiangxi province, en route to Zhuhai,"" Liu wrote in a WeChat post before going incommunicado.

""I asked for a written record [of this interaction], but they refused.""

The incident comes as China has stepped up detentions of dissidents and religious figures ahead of the annual session of its rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress.

Liu, a former member of the now-shuttered public interest law firm Beijing Fengrui, went incommunicado on the eve of the annual session in Beijing, a time when the authorities typically target critics of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.

The lawyer previously represented Ai Weiwei when the globally renowned artist was detained in 2011. Ai once called him “the best lawyer in China”.  

Other clients have included journalists and activists accused of subverting the Chinese Communist Party.

Stopped by rail police

Before going missing, Liu wrote that he had been stopped by rail police while attempting to travel.

The Civil Rights and Livelihood Watch website also reported concerns about Liu's whereabouts, tweeting a message from the lawyer on the day of his ""disappearance.""

""My ID card showed up as invalid when I went through the [automatic security] gates, and it wouldn't let me through with just a train ticket,"" Liu said in comments posted by the group to Twitter.

""Then four railway policemen surrounded me and wouldn't let me go, and the duty supervisor even wanted to confiscate my ID card,"" he wrote.

""[They said] they were assisting the state security police in my hometown of Suichuan county with their investigation,"" Liu said.

A fellow rights lawyer who asked to remain anonymous confirmed the rights groups' accounts.

""Liu [told me] last night that he didn't eat, because he was waiting for them to give him an explanation,"" the lawyer said. ""I haven't been able to contact him since [Wednesday] afternoon.""

""His mobile phone is switched on, but nobody is picking up,"" he said.

He said Liu has been repeatedly harassed and persecuted by the government since he was targeted in a 2015 nationwide police operation that saw hundreds of lawyers, law firm staff and rights activists detained, hauled in for questioning and even jailed for subversion.

Stripped of license

Authorities in Beijing stripped Liu of his license to practice as a lawyer in October 2019 after he published a photo of himself selling insecticide as a street vendor - an image that could be considered “a kind of art…[and] a complaint against the abuse of power” by authorities who had forced the shutdown of his law firm he told RFA at the time.

An employee who answered the phone at the Ganzhou municipal railway police department declined to comment when contacted by Radio Free Asia on Thursday about Liu’s disappearance.

Meanwhile, veteran journalist Gao Yu has been taken to the eastern province of Shandong under police escort, while police in the southwestern province of Guizhou have placed more than a dozen members of the banned Guizhou Human Rights Forum under detention or house arrest, activists told Radio Free Asia.

Prominent dissidents Zha Jianguo and Ji Feng are both under house arrest or close surveillance, as is rights activist Li Wei, who posted that he was ""going out to walk around and shop, with personal carers alongside,"" in an apparent reference to state security police minders.

134,Viet Nam,Vietnam: WHRD poor health condition denied proper treatment (Update),18/03/2023,"Bleeding and apparently afflicted with uterine fibroids, Vietnamese prisoner of conscience Nguyen Thi Tam has been suffering in prison without adequate medical care, her family told Radio Free Asia.

Human rights groups have blamed her condition on horrible prison conditions and demanded her immediate release.

Tam is serving a 6-year sentence at Gia Trung Prison in the southern central province of Gia Lai for “making, storing, distributing or disseminating information, documents and items against the Socialist Republic of Vietnam” in violation of Article 117 of the penal code – a law frequently used by authorities to quiet dissent.

During a phone call on Mar. 3, Tam told her daughter Nguyen Thi Mai that she was suffering from severe bleeding and declining health and had to be sent to the Gia Lai provincial hospital on Feb. 28. She made the 50-kilometer (31-mile) journey in a box truck with no medical personnel on hand. 

""My mother said that she felt exhausted and weak as many parts of the road were bumpy while she was bleeding a lot. However, the driver refused to stop,” Mai told RFA’s Vietnamese Service. “The doctor concluded that my mother had uterine fibroids, but she was not allowed to stay at the hospital for monitoring or proper treatment.""

Tam was sent back to the prison on the same day, and she is now receiving treatment at the prison’s clinic, but the condition has left her weak to the point that she cannot even walk without the help of others.

Dong Tam commune dispute

Authorities arrested Tam and three others in June 2020 for expressing their opinions on social media about a land dispute at the Dong Tam commune that turned violent when authorities raided the commune in January of that year, leading to the deaths of three protesters and a village leader.

Tam has served prison sentences twice before in 2008 and 2014.

Conditions at the prison are difficult, Mai said. She said Tam told her that she was ordered to participate in cleaning the prison, but given no specific goal or target like other inmates, and she was “allowed” to grow vegetables for her own consumption.

Failure to participate in the prison labor would result in constant confinement in her cell and she would be denied opportunities to move around or communicate with other inmates.

Additionally, the prison’s water is unclean, so inmates are forced to buy bottled water from the prison canteen for a 500,000 dong fee (more than US$20).

RFA attempted to contact the Gia Trung Prison to verify the information but no one answered the phone. 

The London-based Amnesty International told RFA that the prison’s failure to provide proper medical treatment to Nguyen Thi Tam has made her ongoing medical problems worse.

Joe Freedman, the media manager for Amnesty International’s Southeast Asia Office, said in an email that three other prisoners of conscience had passed away because of poor or late medical treatment in Vietnamese prisons.

""Amnesty International is calling on the Vietnamese authorities to urgently provide adequate health care to Nguyen Thi Tam and to immediately and unconditionally release her and other activists imprisoned for peacefully exercising their human rights,"" he said.",Right to health
135,Indonesia,Indonesia: Journalists intimidated and threatened for reporting alleged abuse by regional councilpersons,28/03/2023,"A number of journalists are covering the pre-reconstruction case of the alleged abuse by two members of the Medan City DPRD, one of the night entertainment venues, who were intimidated by thugs. The thugs kicked them out and asked them to delete the videos and photos on the cellphones of the journalists who were covering the incident. The pre-reconstruction took place in front of a nightclub on Jalan Abdullah Lubis, Medan City, Monday afternoon, 27 February 2023. As a result, chaos was inevitable because the thugs admitted that a member of the OKP continued to threaten a number of journalists at the scene. ""Eh, don't record it, I'll stab you later. This you mark me Rakesh,"" shouted the man claiming to be named Rakesh.

Rakesh, wearing a purple shirt, did not hesitate to issue a tone threatening to kill journalists. If not leave the location of the reconstruction. ""You delete that video. I'll kill you later,"" said the purple shirt, pointing to journalists at the pre-reconstruction location. Journalists were intimidated, from various media such as online media, newspapers in Medan City to TV ONE journalists who were also targeted by the thugs. Pre-reconstruction was carried out by the Medan Police Criminal Investigation Unit, on suspicion of abuse cases allegedly committed by two members of the Medan DPRD HS and DS against Khalik Fazduani (30) in one of the nightclubs in Medan City.

The beatings started when Khalik was at a nightclub to attend a friend's invitation. When he was about to go home, Khalik saw a crowd of people who were making a fuss. Then Khalik asked, suddenly a man with the initials DRGS hit his forehead. After that, a man with the initials HS also beat him, followed by a man with the initials DS stampede on his body. However, the two members of the Medan City DPRD still have the status of witnesses. In the aftermath of the thugs' intimidation, a number of journalists made a report to the Headquarters of the Medan Polrestabes. The journalists asked the police to arrest the purple-clad thug.

Meanwhile, the Chairperson of AJI Medan, Christison Sondang Pane criticized the intimidation by thugs. He asked the police to arrest the thug immediately. Which is considered to interfere with the work of journalists at the scene. ""When he was about to take a picture, a man claiming to be named Rakes and admitting that he was a member of OKP forbade journalists from reporting. According to media colleagues at the location, Rakesh kicked ST online journalists and threatened AL online journalists. In fact, Rakes also abused TV One journalists. , BS,"" Christison explained.

Christison explained that in carrying out their duties, journalists are protected by Article 8 of Law No. 40 of 1999 concerning the Press. AJI Medan deeply regrets the act of thuggery committed by a man claiming to be suspected of being a member of the OKP.

136,India,India: media worker shot at,06/03/2023,"Authorities in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh must thoroughly investigate the shooting of journalist Devendra Khare and hold those responsible to account, the Committee to Protect Journalists said Thursday.

At about 7:30 p.m. on February 26, two masked men shot at Khare, a reporter for the privately owned Hindi-language broadcaster News1India, at his office in the Chandpur Balu Mandi area of the city of Jaunpur, according to multiple news reports and the journalist, who spoke to CPJ by phone. He was injured in his stomach and right hand and remained hospitalized in stable condition as of March 2, he said.

Khare told CPJ that he believed the attack was retaliation for his February 15 reporting on an alleged assault by the brother of a local political leader.

“The shooting of Devendra Khare underscores the precarious conditions that journalists work under in India,” said Beh Lih Yi, CPJ’s Asia program coordinator. “Uttar Pradesh authorities must swiftly hold the perpetrators accountable and take action to guarantee the safety of journalists throughout the state.”

On February 15, Khare broadcast a news story on News1India alleging that Rituraj Singh, brother of the president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s Jaunpur district branch, had assaulted a fellow right-wing politician, according to those news reports.

On February 18, two of Singh’s associates threatened the journalist at his office, warning him not to report further on the incident, Khare told The Print and CPJ.

Jaunpur police opened an investigation into the shooting, accusing Singh and unidentified individuals of attempted murder, criminal intimidation, and criminal conspiracy, according to those news reports. Khare told CPJ that he had not been informed of any arrests in the case as of March 2.

CPJ texted Jaunpur Circle Officer Kuldeep Kumar Gupta for comment but did not receive any replies. CPJ was unable to find contact details for Singh.

137,Sri Lanka,"Sri Lanka: police violence leads to 15 injured, one death",28/02/2023,"Police in Sri Lanka on Sunday fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters angry over a decision to postpone local elections after the government said it cannot finance them because of the country’s crippling economic crisis.

About 15 people were treated for minor injuries, according to Colombo National Hospital.

Thousands of supporters of the opposition National People’s Power party tried to march toward the main business district in capital Colombo, ignoring police warnings after a court order barred them from entering the area, which includes the president’s residence, office and several key government buildings.

The order had been obtained in the backdrop of last July’s massive protests, when thousands of people stormed the presidential office and residence and occupied them for days. The crisis forced then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and resign.

The turmoil was caused by severe shortages of some foods, fuel, cooking gas and medicine, after Sri Lanka went bankrupt because it could not repay its foreign debt. The new president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, negotiated a rescue package with the International Monetary Fund for $2.9 billion over four years, but it can be finalized only if Sri Lanka’s creditors give assurances on debt restructuring.

Sri Lanka’s total foreign debt exceeds $ 51 billion, of which it must repay $28 billion by 2027. India and several other creditor countries have so far given assurances that meet the IMF standards, but the deal hinges on whether China would agree to debt restructuring at the same level.

The Finance Ministry under Wickremesinghe said it can’t allocate sufficient funds for the March 9 elections for town and village councils, even though political parties had submitted nominations.

The decision forced the Election Commission to indefinitely postpone the elections.

Despite signs of progress in reducing shortages and ending daily power cuts after nearly a year, Wickremesinghe is immensely unpopular. Many people say he lacks the mandate because he was elected by lawmakers backed by Rajapaksa supporters. They accuse Wickremesinghe of protecting members of the Rajapaksa family from corruption allegations in return for backing him in Parliament.

The National People’s Power party, which organized Sunday’s rally, has only three lawmakers in Sri Lanka’s 225-member Parliament but it enjoys a wave of public support after the economic crisis eroded the popularity of traditional political parties that have ruled Sri Lanka since independence.

An individual who was admitted to the Colombo National Hospital following the protest staged by the Jathika Jana Balavegaya in Colombo on Sunday (27) has died.

The turmoil was caused by severe shortages of some foods, fuel, cooking gas and medicine, after Sri Lanka went bankrupt because it could not repay its foreign debt. The new president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, negotiated a rescue package with the International Monetary Fund for $2.9 billion over four years, but it can be finalized only if Sri Lanka’s creditors give assurances on debt restructuring.

Sri Lanka’s total foreign debt exceeds $ 51 billion, of which it must repay $28 billion by 2027. India and several other creditor countries have so far given assurances that meet the IMF standards, but the deal hinges on whether China would agree to debt restructuring at the same level.

The Finance Ministry under Wickremesinghe said it can’t allocate sufficient funds for the March 9 elections for town and village councils, even though political parties had submitted nominations.

The decision forced the Election Commission to indefinitely postpone the elections.

Despite signs of progress in reducing shortages and ending daily power cuts after nearly a year, Wickremesinghe is immensely unpopular. Many people say he lacks the mandate because he was elected by lawmakers backed by Rajapaksa supporters. They accuse Wickremesinghe of protecting members of the Rajapaksa family from corruption allegations in return for backing him in Parliament.

The National People’s Power party, which organized Sunday’s rally, has only three lawmakers in Sri Lanka’s 225-member Parliament but it enjoys a wave of public support after the economic crisis eroded the popularity of traditional political parties that have ruled Sri Lanka since independence.

An individual who was admitted to the Colombo National Hospital following the protest staged by the Jathika Jana Balavegaya in Colombo on Sunday (27) has died.

General Secretary of the JVP Tilvin Silva speaking to reporters in Colombo on Monday (27) said a peaceful protest by the JJB was attacked, and as a result of an attack around 28 people were hospitalized due to injuries.

""Two people were in critical condition. One of them passed away on Monday (27) afternoon. He was one named, Nimal Amarasiri, a candidate for the Nivithigala Pradeshiya Sabha of the Ratnapura District,"" he added.

Silva said the government led by Ranil Wickremesinghe should be responsible for the life that was lost, adding that the JJB did not want any confrontation with police and only wanted to protest demanding their right for an election.",Right to healthy and safe environment
138,Cambodia,Cambodia: seven community-based defenders face enhanced judicial harassment,06/03/2023,"Nine Boeng Tamok lake residents face charges of “intentional acts of violence and obstruction of public officials” and were placed under court supervision following a February 21 warrant issued by the Phnom Penh Municipal court.

The residents received the warrant in the morning and were ordered to appear in court by the afternoon. They did not attend because their lawyer from human rights NGO Licadho was unavailable, they said. 

Court spokesperson Y Rin said there was no further information to share and Lim Sokuntheara, the judge who issued the warrant, could not be reached for comment.

For years, the outspoken residents of Samraong Tboung village on the outskirts of Phnom Penh have protested the filling-in of Boeng Tamok, one of the capital’s last remaining natural lakes. They are also on the verge of being evicted from their homes and losing their livelihoods fishing and harvesting vegetation from the lake as a series of land giveaways to well-connected elites and developers transform the landscape.

Prak Sophea, a prominent activist and resident of Samraong Tboung village along the lake, denied the allegations. She said the charges likely arose after an altercation between authorities and residents in October last year. 

Local authorities had barred residents from making home repairs on the grounds they were illegal squatters and gave them packs of noodles as compensation. A group of frustrated villagers later burned the donated gifts in front of village security officers, who kicked the embers at them. In response, the villagers threw rice. The embers burned Sophea and forced her to visit the hospital for treatment, she said. 

“Should we stand for the authorities to beat us, can we not defend ourselves?” said Sophea, a 43-year-old mother of three. “Does the law allow us to protect ourselves or let the authorities beat people?”

Committing an “intentional act of violence” carries a maximum of three years imprisonment and a six million riel fine, while “obstruction of public officials” could lead to a one year prison sentence and two million riel fine, according to the Cambodian criminal code. 

Sophea and at least 10 villagers have already been ordered to appear in court a combined three times since 2022. 

The Phnom Penh Municipal Court previously issued a court summons in August 2022 for seven representatives of Samraong Tboung village, including Sophea. The Prek Pnov district head of security claimed the residents had committed obstruction of public officials, incitement and public disorder.

Soeun Sreysoth, 32, said herself, her husband and her brother were named in the most recent court summons. She added that she is disappointed as they had merely sought to raise their voices to secure legal land ownership of property they have occupied for years.

“It is injustice for citizens because we are just advocating, fighting for our housing rights, but the authorities issued a warrant to threaten us,” she said.

According to urban poor NGO Sahmakum Teang Tnaut (STT), at least 2,244.45 hectares of the lake’s 3,239.69 hectares have been filled in with sand, following a 2016 sub-decree allowing the government to rent or sell land in and around the lake.

In recent years, filled-in areas around Boeng Tamok lake have been distributed to wealthy and powerful individuals and companies. Recipients include ruling party CPP senator Kok An, Chea Sophalen, the daughter of Land Minister Chea Sophara, military commanders Vong Pisen and Sao Sokha and the famous singer Preap Sovath.

Out of many companies, the director of Orkide Villa, Nuth Ton also received 67 hectares of Boeng Tamok lake in September last year. Orkide is chaired by Prime Minister Hun Sen’s daughter Hun Mana, while his other daughter Hun Maly and daughter-in-law Pich Chanmony are also directors in Orkide-brand firms.

Samraong Tboung villagers have not received any land titles or been classified as legal residents but they have always been able to vote for elections, they say.

Soeung Saran, STT’s executive director, said he appreciated development around Phnom Penh but not without consideration of its impact.

“Before developing, we should think about the long-term impact on society and the environment,” he said. “I would like to see more assessments of the social, economic, and environmental impacts before making a decision to modify the land.”

Am Phoeun, a mother of four named in the August 2022 court summons, said that while she has making a living fishing from the lake since 2007, she is now preparing to migrate to Thailand to find another source of income.

“Due to the development and landfill of the lake, We don’t have an income except to decide to migrate,” she said. “We used to depend on fishing, but when the authorities landfill the lake, my family and I got a big effect from it.”

Sophea, she asked the government to find justice for citizens and to let them live where they are because she thought that she would get enough income by living here, such as by selling drinking water. 

“We have lost income from development, so we want to live in the development area,” she said. “We can do business [there].”

“We are deeply hurt and frustrated by the authorities,” she continued. “It is one of the most unfair things that the people of the lake have no right to live there while only high officials, companies and institutions have the right to live there.”",Right to healthy and safe environment

139,Pakistan,Pakistan: SOGI rights defender survives gun attack after threats,06/03/2023,"Marvia Malik, Pakistan’s first transgender news anchor for Kohenoor TV, has survived an ambush by two gunmen on return to her Lahore home and previously receiving death threats from unknown individuals. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), and its Pakistan affiliate, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), condemn the attack on Marvia Malik and urge the Pakistani government to expedite investigations into the incident to protect working journalists.

On February 25, a case was registered against unknown assailants for their attack on Marvia Malik, Pakistan's first transgender news anchor. According to a First Information Report launched by the anchor, she was fired upon by two suspects on return to her home from a nearby pharmacy. Malik has since left Lahore to ensure her safety, returning recently for a surgery.  

According to her police statement, the television presenter said that she had received threatening phone calls and texts from unknown numbers for her advocacy for the transgender community. She also asserted that her activism was a “major factor” in the attempted killing,  

Since 2013, journalists in Pakistan have faced increasing threats, violence and legal repression, with investigations often failing to identify perpetrators. In 2022, 80% of IFJ-documented deaths in Pakistan resulted from gun violence.  

In 2018, Malik became Pakistan’s first transgender news anchor at the age of 21, after funding her way through journalism school by working as a make-up artist in the fashion sector. She previously made history by being the first transgender model to walk the runway at the Pakistan Fashion Design Council's annual fashion show.  

The PFUJ said: “The PFUJ strongly condemns the armed assault on Marvia Malik and requests the IG Punjab Police arrest and imprison the perpetrators. Violence in this manner is unacceptable, and the offenders should be apprehended and jailed.”  

The IFJ said: “Pakistan's government must take appropriate measures to ensure media workers' safety and security, as required by law. Threats of assault, violence and death limit the capacity for journalists to operate without fear. The IFJ condemns the threats and attack against Marvia Malik and urges Pakistani authorities to investigate the incident swiftly and transparently.”",Right to healthy and safe environment
140,Thailand,Thailand: pro-democracy WHRDs continue to be target of harassment,28/02/2023,"On 26 February, Tantawan Tuatulanon and Orawan Phuphong, two activists who spent the previous evening protesting in front of the Supreme Court, declared they would continue staging their hunger strike there.

Their message was delivered by Krisadang Nutcharas, Tantawan and Orawan’s lawyer. The two left Thammasat hospital after being treated for almost a month while conducting a fast to demand bail rights for political prisoners and reform of the judicial system.

Krisadang said that as the two have been on hunger strike for over 30 days, they risk infection by protesting on the street. Despite doctors advising them to remain in a well-equipped hospital, they insist on continuing.

Sunday was Tantawan and Orawan’s third day protesting outside the confines of prison and the hospital.  They withdrew their bail requests late last January and shortly after, announced that they would go on a month-long fast.

Their three nights out have not been easy. Krisadang said the two received threatening phone calls, were photographed by plainclothes police, and were disturbed by motorcycle riders wearing outfits of a group that opposed them. Their request for a public toilet vehicle was also refused on the grounds that the demonstration area is within 150 metres of the palace - a no-protest zone.

The lawyer said Tantawan and Orawan would seek approval from the Court, via the head of the Supreme Court, to continue protesting within the Court’s fenced domain. The request was to be filed on Monday morning.

To show solidarity with Tantawan and Orawan, a number of other demonstrators also gathered front of the Court. Among them were Bencha Saengchantra, a lawmaker from Move Forward Party (MFP), and Sopon Surariddhidhamrong, an activist who was recently allowed bail after his no-sleep protest streak, which resulted in lingering damage to his nervous system.

As of 26 February, three political dissidents remain in detention pending trial - Thiranai, Khathathon, and Chaiyaporn (surnames withheld in all cases). Their release was among the immediate demands of Tantawan and Orawan. At the same day, the Court once again stood on refusing bail for Thiranai and Chaiyaporn on 26 Sunday, fearing them escaping the trial.

Their other demands include reform of the judicial system to guarantee human rights and freedom of expression. They also demand that every political party move to guarantee people’s rights, freedoms, and political participation by backing the repeal of the royal defamation and sedition laws.",Right to Protest

142,Philippines,Philippines: indigenous group prevented from meeting Prime Minister,27/02/2023,"Members of the Dumagat-Remontado indigenous group whose lands and culture will be threatened by the Kaliwa Dam ended their nine-day walk to the nation’s capital on Thursday evening without having the opportunity to discuss with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. their concerns about the P12.2-billion project. 

Indigenous peoples from the provinces of Rizal and Quezon arrived in Manila on Thursday, in hopes of having a dialogue with Marcos to get him to stop the construction of the dam. 

But when marchers reached Mendiola, they were met with police who blocked and prevented them from reaching the gates of Malacañang. They instead ended their 150-kilometer journey, which began in Quezon’s General Nakar town, in Paco Catholic Church. 

“We are sad that we will return to our homes without the good news that our communities expect: that our concerns will be heard,” indigenous peoples’ leader Conchita Calzado told Philstar.com. 

For nine days, hundreds of Dumagat-Remontados and their supporters traversed towns in Quezon, Laguna and Rizal, and the streets of Metro Manila telling people that the Kaliwa Dam will submerge their ancestral domain, threaten their livelihoods and destroy their cultural heritage. 

Along the way, the marchers encountered individuals telling them they can no longer do anything and those accusing them of being used by interest groups and communist rebels, which they deny. 

“I voluntarily joined this ‘Alay Lakad’ to let the authorities and the public know that residents of Makid-ata have been resisting the dam project since the start,” Silvino Astoveza told Philstar.com.

“I am already old, so why am I still standing against the project? I am doing this for my children, for the next generation,” the 70-year-old Dumagat elder said. 

Earlier in the day, the marchers went to the offices of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System, the proponent of the project. The MWSS on Tuesday awarded a “disturbance fee” of P160 million to a faction of Dumagat-Remontados who gave their consent for the dam project.
Solution to Manila’s water woes

Kaliwa Dam, which will be funded by a loan from China, was a flagship project of former President Rodrigo Duterte’s “Build, Build, Build” program. 

The dam is pushed as a solution to Metro Manila’s water problems by supplying some 600 million liters a day to the capital region’s 14 million people. Metro Manila currently relies on Angat Dam in Bulacan for water supply.

Like other indigenous peoples, the Dumagat-Remontados of Sierra Madre are deeply connected with nature. 

“If we move to the lowlands, it will be hard to call ourselves indigenous peoples because we’ll live a life that we’re not used to. We don’t want that to happen to our children and the next generation,” Calzado said. 

According to groups opposed to Kaliwa Dam, 1,400 Dumagat-Remontado families in Rizal and Quezon will be affected by the project. Government agencies, however, said that only 46 families will be impacted. 

Indigenous peoples’ communities and environment groups also stressed that the Kaliwa Dam will destroy Sierra Madre — the longest mountain range in the country that historically serves as a buffer against storms that hit Luzon. 
Fight continues

The grueling journey to the capital region left them with blisters and aching bodies, and did not end the way they hoped. But the outcome did not crush their will to fight for the preservation of their land and their way of life. 

This, after all, was not the first time that they marched to voice out their opposition to a mega-dam project. In 2009, members of Dumagat-Remontado communities walked to the capital for nine days to protest the Laiban Dam project.

The strong opposition of various sectors prompted the government to shelve the project. The victory, however, was short-lived.

Calzado said they were grateful for the support they received from different sectors, and to the police who escorted them.

“Maybe the next thing we’ll do is to call on the general public who will be affected by the Kaliwa Dam to support us in our fight to stop the project,” she said.",Freedom of assembly

143,Myanmar,Myanmar: five relatives of pro-democracy defender brutally killed,06/03/2023,"A family of five, including a 3-year-old boy and an 80-year-old man, were gunned down in their Yangon home by six people in civilian clothes – believed to be pro-junta militia members – as frightened neighbors looked on.

The family is related to Win Soe, a secondary school teacher who is also an activist with the anti-junta Civil Disobedience Movement, often called the CDM. The Feb. 22 killings shows that activists – and their families – are also being targeted in urban areas, not just the countryside.

A person close to the family, who refused to be named for security reasons, told Radio Free Asia that six people in civilian clothes came to the house on two motorcycles and asked whether household members were related to Win Soe, who has been in hiding since the 2021 military coup d’etat.

“There was no one in the street, as the night was dark and because of the unsafe security situation,” the person said. “I thought they were there to buy some dried fish, as usual. Then they asked them to crouch down and not to look up and asked if they were the family of Win Soe. 

“I think they answered that they were. That’s when they shot three times at each of them – two times only in the head,” the person said. “They even shot at the little kid.”

Locals believe the killings in the Yeik Thar ward of Hlegu township was the work of the pro-junta groups, but exactly which group was responsible was unknown. RFA tried to contact the police station in Hlegu township, but the call went unanswered. 

Pro-junta supporters have formed militia groups with the help of the military in some townships. They often target and attack supporters of the opposition party and political activists. 

More than 250,000 education workers have boycotted their government jobs to protest military rule and have joined the CDM, the shadow National Unity Government said last year.

Of those, junta authorities had killed at least 33 and arrested 218 others as of the end of 2022, according to statistics compiled by the Thailand-based Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma).

Specifically targeted

A lawyer in Yangon, who refused to be named for security reasons, said the killing of a defenseless child and an elderly man shows the failure of the rule of law in the country.

“You can see that this was specifically targeted,” the lawyer said. “What this shows is that the rule of law in the country has almost completely broken down and the people are not free, not safe, and their freedom and safety are not protected by any organization.”

These kinds of mass killings, which have been happening sporadically since the coup, are leading the country toward failed state status, said Kyaw Win, director of the Burma Human Rights Network.

“The military junta wanted to prove that it can rule the country but it cannot even protect the people from such crimes and the junta itself is also the one who commits these crimes,” he said. 

The family members were named as: San Nwet, a 50-year-old woman, Ko Maung and Win Nwe, each 30 years old, and Aung Maung, the 80-year-old man. The 3-year-old boy was not named. They were buried in Hpaung Gyi cemetery on Feb. 25, local sources said.

“Recent red-tagging and the calling of my advocacy as ‘diabolical and demonic’ by the SMNI’s television program ‘Laban Kasama ang Bayan’ (during the Feb. 22, 2023 segment), by its hosts will never stop our commitment to peace and justice,” said Bishop Gerardo Alminaza, vice chairman of the

CBCP’s Episcopal Commission on Social Action, Justice, and Peace (ECSA-JP).

“As your pastor, I cannot be silent amid violence and injustices,” he also said in a statement.

In the episode, the program hosts, particularly Lorraine Marie Badoy and Jeffrey “Ka Eric” Celiz, repeatedly assailed Alminaza and his advocacies for supposedly making similar claims as the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army (CPP-NPA).

This is in response to earlier statements made by Alminaza as convenor of the Pilgrims for Peace calling for the resumption of peace talks between the Philippine government and the CPP-NPA.

Alminaza said turning silent means surrendering the welfare of the perennial victims of similar red-tagging acts.

“As this TV program continues to malign and even invoke vicious threats against the work of Church people, bishops and pastors, dedicated activists, and ordinary persons, we should never be afraid, but rather be brave in speaking for the truth on behalf of the victims of injustice,” he said.

He also stressed that his advocacies and statements have enough basis, based on his personal knowledge.

“In the past, I have spoken of Toto Patigas, Zara Alvarez, and Dr. Sancelan, among others, whose killings remain unsolved. They had dedicated their lives to the quest for a just and lasting peace,” said Alminaza.

Bishop Alminaza is steadfast in his advocacy for lasting peace in Negros Island and in the whole country. He is also an advocate of environmental protection.",Right to healthy and safe environment
145,Kazakhstan,Kazakhstan: another media worker assaulted,27/02/2023,"A journalist has been assaulted in Kazakhstan amid a series of attacks against independent reporters as early parliamentary elections in the oil-rich Central Asian nation draw near.

Daniyar Moldabekov says he was attacked in the morning on February 22 in the corridor of his apartment building by a masked man in Kazakhstan’s largest city, Almaty.

Moldabekov told RFE/RL that he was returning home from a coffee shop when a man wearing a medical mask hit him in the jaw with a single blow that dazed him.

""He hit me and shouted 'Hey, don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong!' and quickly left the premises,"" Moldabekov said, adding that the attack was most likely linked to his latest investigative reports about alleged corruption in the city.

""I will not stop. I will continue working as a journalist. That is for sure. And I will write about anyone I want to,"" Moldabekov said. He did not say which of his reports could be behind the attack.

The Almaty city police department told RFE/RL that the attack is under investigation.

Attacks against journalists in the tightly controlled former Soviet republic have been on the rise since early January as the country gets ready for early parliamentary elections scheduled for March 19.

On February 20, another Almaty-based journalist and vlogger Vadim Boreiko said that two cars belonging to his cameraman, Roman Yegorov, were burned in an arson attack.

Boreiko and Yegorov said the attack was linked to their professional activities.

In early February, the chief editor of the Ulysmedia.kz news website in Almaty, Samal Ibraeva, received a box from unknown people that contained a hunk of meat and pictures of her children. She described the package as a fresh attempt ""to intimidate"" her and her staff.

Several other attacks were registered in Kazakhstan last month.

International human rights watchdogs and the embassies of several Western nations have urged Kazakh authorities to investigate the attacks.",Right to healthy and safe environment
146,Viet Nam,Vietnam: social media activist re-arrested on same charges,27/02/2023,"Authorities in Vietnam arrested activist Le Minh The for allegedly posting “illegal content” on his Facebook page, in violation of a vaguely worded law routinely used to suppress independent bloggers and journalists. 

The was charged with “abusing the rights to freedom and democracy to violate the State’s interests and legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals” under Article 331, state media reported. 

International human rights organizations have said Article 331 and other vaguely written and arbitrarily applied laws are tools for the government to silence dissenting voices and restrict freedom of speech.

The, born in 1963, completed a two-year jail term for the same charge in July 2020, the state media report said. 

Authorities did not specify what the illegal content on his Facebook account was, but his most recent post was about U.S. President Joe Biden visiting Ukraine on Tuesday. 

Other posts on the account were information, images, and videos about Vietnam, a police summons issued to  Le Thi Binh – The’s younger sister, to discuss her livestream videos, Vietnam’s VinFast electric cars, and a recent RFA report about an ex-con former fortune-teller who was ordained as a Catholic priest under seemingly shady circumstances. 

The indictment for The’s previous violation in 2019 said that he contacted and exchanged information “with inside and outside reactionary forces on social media platforms” in hopes of inciting them to join demonstrations and topple the Vietnamese government.

Mr The - 60 years old - completed his 2-year jail sentence in July 2020, for abuse democratic freedoms.

On 22 Feb 2023, Binh Thuy ward, Can Tho city, again arrested and prosecuted him for the same offence.

State media reported Mr The often published, shared articles with 'illegal content' on his Facebook for others to share and comment.

 

His last status on his Facebook dated 21 Feb, was the image of US President Biden visiting Ukraine.

 

Other articles on his Fb included information on Vietnam situation, recent police summon for his sister Ms Le Thi Binh - who completed her 2-year jail sentence for abuse democratic freedoms in Nov 2022, VinFast's electric vehicles, RFA's report on the recent ordination of Catholic priest Ho Huu Hoa - a bribery convict, who was suspected of being ordained by deceptive means.",Right to liberty and security
147,Myanmar,Myanmar: prominent defender trial starts (Update),26/02/2023,"Myanmar’s military junta should drop politically motivated charges against the Kachin Baptist leader Reverend Hkalam Samson and immediately release him, Human Rights Watch said today. Rev. Samson’s next hearing, on counterterrorism law charges, which only his lawyer is permitted to attend, is scheduled for February 21, 2023, at a special court inside Myitkyina prison.

“The junta’s politically motivated case against Rev. Hkalam Samson, who is internationally renowned for his humanitarian and community work, shows that no one is safe in Myanmar,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The junta should drop the baseless charges against Rev. Samson and immediately and unconditionally release him.”

On December 5, 2022, junta immigration officials and police arrested Rev. Samson at Mandalay International Airport, preventing him from leaving the country. Junta authorities have not disclosed his whereabouts but are apparently holding him at Myitkyina prison where the hearings are being held in a closed court. His family have not been allowed to see or communicate with him since his arrest.

In December, the junta charged Rev. Samson under section 17 of the Unlawful Associations Act for allegedly meeting with ethnic Kachin armed group leaders in January 2022, and section 505A of the penal code for “incitement” after holding a group prayer with members of the opposition National Unity Government (NUG). The offenses carry prison terms of up to 3 years each. The junta frequently uses vaguely worded and loosely interpreted provisions in its penal code to imprison peaceful activists. The hearings for these two charges concluded on February 14 with no verdict.

On February 14, the junta announced an additional charge against Rev. Samson under section 52A of the counterterrorism law for allegedly meeting with a member of the opposition National Unity Government, punishable by up to seven years in prison.

Rev. Samson, 65, is the former head of the Kachin Baptist Convention and is chairman of the Kachin National Consultative Assembly, which facilitated peace talks with the previous National League for Democracy party civilian government.

In 2019, he was among a group of 27 representatives from 17 countries to meet then US President Donald Trump in Washington, DC to highlight the plight of victims of ethnic and religious persecution. Shortly after the trip, the military opened a case against him for his comments at the White House criticizing Myanmar’s persecution of Christian minority groups. The authorities dropped the case after the US State Department expressed concern.

Since the military coup in February 2021, junta security forces have carried out deadly crackdowns against the political opposition to military rule, arbitrarily detained more than 19,000 people, and committed numerous crimes against humanity and war crimes across the country, documented by Human Rights Watch and other groups.

Myanmar’s junta courts are neither independent nor provide basic fair trial rights. Many trials are held in grossly unjust closed-door military tribunals or in “special courts” inside prison facilities where detainees gain access to their lawyer only on the day of their trial.

United Nations member countries, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), in particular, Indonesia as chair of ASEAN, and other concerned governments should press the junta to immediately release all those wrongfully detained or imprisoned, including Rev. Samson.

“The prosecution of a high-profile Kachin religious figure like Rev. Samson is a heavy-handed attempt to chill all dissent among ethnic minority leaders,” Pearson said. “ASEAN and other concerned governments should press for the release of Rev. Samson and others wrongfully detained since the February 2021 coup.",Right to liberty and security

148,Cambodia,"Cambodia: union leader, eight co-defendants trial starts (Update)",27/02/2023,"NagaWorld union leader Chhim Sithar and eight co-defendants appeared for their first day of trial in Phnom Penh Municipal Court on Tuesday. Sithar and all her colleagues, except for one, denied the incitement charges against them.

Prosecutors claim that Sithar and her fellow union members are guilty of incitement to disturb security for leading a union strike for more than a year after Phnom Penh authorities declared the labor movement illegal. 

Over the course of the three and a half hour hearing, Presiding judge Soeung Chakriya focused on questioning Sithar about the union’s funding, especially from international donors.

Sithar acknowledged she had requested and received funds to support the union’s activities from three international donors: U.S.-based non-profit East West Management Institute (EWMI), feminist NGO JASS and North American union Unite Here.

The three organizations could not be reached for comment.

Sithar said the union received $10,000 from EWMI, $15,000 from JASS and $5,000 from Unite Here as “humanitarian funds” to aid members laid off during Covid-19.

“I made proposals for receiving funds to support the union’s operations and humanitarian funds in helping members during COVID-19, and layoff jobs,” Sithar said.

Deputy prosecutor Seng Heang said that Sithar had led the illegal protest without permission from Phnom Penh municipal authorities and that international funds support the union’s illegal activities.

“I have observed they [workers] have protested [from] morning till evening with no other job [to support their livelihood],” he said.

“They’re volunteers who come [to strike] and they’re willing to do so,” Sithar replied.

She said the strike was peaceful, legal and protected by the Cambodian constitution’s right to freedom expression.

Approximately 1,300 workers initiated the strike on December 18, 2021 to demand the reinstatement of 365 laid off NagaWorld employees following mass lay-offs and lack of full severance pay. More than one year later, 100 employees still protest their lay-offs.

Sithar, president of the Labour Rights Supported Union of Khmer Employee of NagaWorld (LRSU), has stated the union has followed all legal protocol for the strike. The union has said it only launched a strike after all viable efforts at mediation were exhausted. 

But Sithar and her eight fellow union members — Chhim Sokhorn, Hay Sopheap, Kleang Soben, Ry Sovandy, Sok Kongkea, Sok Narith, Sun Sreypich, and Touch Sereymeas — were arrested in January last year and placed in pre-trial detention. They were released from Prey Sar prison on bail in March. 

Sithar was re-arrested in November last year and detained for allegedly violating bail.

Only one defendant, Kongkea, accepted the charges of incitement in court but later declined to speak with reporters. 

Senior Adhoc investigator Yi Soksan said the government, Ministry of Labor and NagaWorld had unfairly dismissed efforts to resolve the strikers demands by instead handing the issue to the system.

“I see that the Royal Government as well as the Ministry of Labor does not seem to care about this labor dispute, they are [Nagaworld staff] laid off unfairly by the company and then the court charges with accusing them of inciting unrest and undermining social security.”

Ministry of Labor spokesperson Heng Sour said in a Telegram message to CamboJA that labor conflicts between former employees of NagaWorld have been settled at the court stage.

“However, he ministry will continue to mediate through the mechanism of the strike and demonstration commission at the request of the conflicting parties,” he said.

NagaWorld could not be reached for comment.

President of Cambodian Alliance of Trade Unions Yang Sophorn attended the trial and said she believed LRSU members had legitimate reasons and legal cause to strike but this was ignored by the court.

“Prosecutor questioned tried to place blame, it isn’t about finding justice for Sithar only protecting the interests of the company,” Sophorn told CamboJA News. “[The court] does not mean to find justice for parties involved.”

“I think that the incitement charge was exaggerated because Sithar has tried to explain the root cause of striking and workers’ demands that they have a right to disagree with the employer,” Sophorn added.

Laid off NagaWorld union member Nop Tithboravy and around 100 fellow union members protested outside the court on the day of the hearing.

Tithboravy said she and her colleagues had received numerous threats from the government and struggled to support their families financially after more than one year of striking, refusing to accept the company’s terms.

“I hope the court will bring justice to everyone because we are doing a strike to seek freedom at our workplace and want to go back to work,” she said. “ We don’t have income to support our family, we want to go back to work.”

Tithboravy said the strikers would not end their strike unless the company reinstated all workers and the court dropped all charges against the union members.

The trial is scheduled to resume on February 28.

Outside the court following the hearing, Sithar’s younger brother Chhim Pros said his sister had only followed the law in leading the strike.

“[Sithar] has always helped people from a young age,” he said. “She is just an ordinary girl, she has no ability to destroy the peace in our country.”",Freedom of assembly

Who wrote the scripts and whether she stands by those words -- the notice asked.

Neha Singh Rathore of 'UP Mein Ka Ba' fame has been served a notice by the Kanpur Police on Tuesday night for allegedly inciting hatred through her song video. Neha Singh Rathore's U Mein Ka Ba was released ahead of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election 2022, after the success of his Bihar mein Ka ba in 2020. On February 16, the singer released the second part of UP Mein Ka Ba regarding which the notice has been served on her asking whether she wrote the lyrics of the songs.

The singer shared a video of her receiving the notice. ""Who is making you do all these?"" the singer said to the cops as she received the notice. Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia called the move by the Uttar Pradesh police shameful and said, ""Is the BJP so scared of the voice of a folk singer?""

151,Viet Nam,Vietnam: pro-democracy defenders placed under house arrest,20/02/2023,"Known dissidents prevented from going to public memorials to pay respect to Vietnamese civilians and soldiers killed by the Chinese during the war

RFA Viet 17 Feb https://www.rfa.org/vietnamese/news/vietnamnews/commemoration-of-sino-vietnam-war-prevented-by-security-forces-02172023075452.html

 

The police from two major cities HCMC and Hanoi continued to prevent citizens to pay respect to those killed by the Chinese during the war.

On 17 Feb, local authorities reportedly deployed the police, civilian guards, neighbourhood security personnel... to guard private residences of activists and blocked entry to public memorials of Vietnamese heroes [in the fight against Chinese invaders in history] such as King Ly Thai To memorial in Hanoi, General Tran Hung Dao memorial in Bach Dang wharf, HCMC.

 

Dissident poet Hoang Hung - a member of the independent writers' league Van Doan Doc Lap - told RFA Viet he and his wife tried to go to Bach Dang wharf on Fri 17 Feb.

 

... When we reached the gate of our apartment block, two policemen politely stopped us and said 'don't go anywhere today'.

They said 'we received order to stop you two from leaving. To pay respect [to those killed in the war] is the right thing to do, but [our superiors] are afraid some people take advantage of this activity to cause troubles, please understand, don't go anywhere today'.

 

Mr Hung's two brothers were fallen soldiers, one sacrificed his life in the war against the Chinese [in 1979], the other one in the war against Cambodia's Polpot [1978 - 1989].

 

Mr Le Than, president of Le Hieu Dang club - members include former Party officials / members turned democracy supporters - told RFA Viet he managed to come to Bach Dang wharf to pay respect at General Tran Hung Dao memorial, as he had left his house the previous day. On 17 Feb, in the morning, he came back and stood hidden at a location close to the memorial, waiting for friends to come as they had planned, but he didn't see anyone known to him who had managed to come close to the memorial.

 

He said the authorities allowed citizens to light joss sticks to pay respect [at the memorial], but wanted people categorised as ""sensitive elements"" such as poet Hoang Hung, Prof Mac Van Trang, himself, to stay home.

 

In Hanoi, on 17 Feb, Mrs Hoang Ha said she was under police guard.

'My house is still under police surveillance. Since last night [16 Feb], [the police] rang me and came to my place to check if I was home. This morning [17 Feb], people had been deployed [to my place] to guard me.'

Later, her daughter rode a motorbike with her sitting behind and managed to leave home without being stopped. She wasn't sure the police didn't find out or they knew but ignored them.  However, when she returned home after going to Tay Tuu cemetery (Tu Liem district) to pay respect to fallen soldiers in the war - several thousands were laid to rest there - the police were still guarding her place.

Mr Le Hoang, an active member of No-U Hanoi (an anti-Chinese hegemony soccer club), told RFA Viet, since early morning [17 Feb], the local police already came to his place then left to go to a coffee shop for their morning coffee, after telling him, he 'could go to Tay Tuu cemetery to pay respect, but don't go to [Hoan Kiem] riverside,  or we [the police] will stop you and cause you trouble'.

He said when he travelled past Ly Thai To memorial, he saw many police and civilian guards deployed there, ready to take action when the crowd was getting bigger.

Mr Le Than, Mr Le Hoang, Mrs Hoang Ha noted that the police's attitude towards them on this occasion was more easy going compared with previous years. Mr Le Hoang said, in previous years, many activists were detained or arrested on days of commemoration of the wars against the Chinese.",Freedom of movement

154,China,China: at least five detained for protest,27/02/2023,"Chinese police have detained at least five activists who supported recent mass protests in two major cities against the slashing of retirees’ medical insurance benefits earlier this month, Radio Free Asia has learned.

Among those detained was veteran rights activist Zhang Hai, who was picked up by authorities in the southern city of Shenzhen, a resident of Wuhan who gave only the surname Zhang said.

""One of five people detained in connection with the silver protests was Zhang Hai – I heard he was detained in Shenzhen,"" the woman said. ""There was also a 23-year-old man who was detained for singing The Internationale with some older people.""

The detentions come after thousands of people took to the streets of two Chinese cities – Wuhan and Dalian – on Feb. 15 in a second mass protest over major cuts to their medical benefits. 

Protesters were shown in social media video clips singing the communist anthem ""The Internationale"" as well as China's national anthem.

""There was also a taxi driver called Shu Li, who was detained around Feb. 20,"" Zhang said. ""He was detained for going to support [the protests].""

Shu was handed a 10-day administrative jail sentence, which can be handed out for up to 15 days to people the police see as troublemakers. However, many detainees aren't released but held under criminal charges when the administrative sentence is complete.

Zhang said Wuhan-based rights activist A Meng was detained in Shanghai and brought back to Wuhan after he supported the protests, while fellow activist Bai Yun had also been detained.

She said the five she named were only the cases she knew about.

""There are probably many more than that, who have been counted,"" Zhang said.

Zhang Hai's arrest came after he reposted video clips of the protests in Wuhan, along with media reports and comments to his Twitter account.

Zhang Hai, who lives in Shenzhen, became an outspoken critic of the ruling Chinese Communist Party since the pandemic prompted a city-wide lockdown in Wuhan and killed his father. 

In June 2022, the authorities placed restrictions on his bank cards, with many transactions blocked, he told Radio Free Asia at the time. 

Zhang was recently asked to submit additional proof of ID in recent transactions via his account at the Bank of China Nantou branch in the southern city of Shenzhen, where he currently lives.

Similar restrictions have been placed on several of his bank cards since the beginning of this year, he told RFA, while online banking transactions often fail to go through, he said.

""He didn't only speak out for his father, but also stood up for the rights of other bereaved families,"" Zhang said. ""He became a voice for all vulnerable groups.""

Silver protests

Another Wuhan resident who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals, said police in her local area have also been investigating people who took part in the so-called silver protests.

""There was one person who gave interviews to a lot of reporters in Wuhan over the past three years,"" she said. ""They started following him on Feb. 15, and he was snatched away by some [identified] people on Feb. 16.""

""He was locked up in the police station for several hours – there is a state of red terror here in Wuhan right now,"" she said.

The silver protests began on Feb. 8 outside the municipal government in Wuhan, with retirees warning more action would follow in the absence of a response from officials.

An official account on social media described protesters on Feb. 16 as having been ""bewitched by rumors"" and warned people not to believe ""rumors"" that medical insurance reforms will leave pensioners worse off. 

The protests came after warnings from the central government in Beijing that it won’t be bailing out cash-strapped local governments, whose coffers have been drained by three years of President Xi Jinping’s zero-COVID policy, which ended in December.

155,Afghanistan,Afghanistan: WHRD abducted after house raid,25/04/2023,"

The Taliban’s rise to power in Afghanistan has led to the implementation of strict Islamic law, resulting in the complete ban on education for girls. The barbaric regime’s oppressive actions have left women and children in a constant state of fear, with the latest victim being Mrs. Zarifa Rahmat.

Prior to the Taliban’s reign, Mrs. Rahmat was a private school teacher, but after the extremist group took over, she was forced to abandon her profession. Despite the ban, Mrs. Rahmat continued to teach young girls in her neighborhood in Kabul. However, on the 15th of February, Mrs. Rahmat became a target of the Taliban’s ruthless oppression. At 1 AM, the Taliban’s intelligence unit, known as Directorate 40, forcefully broke into Mrs. Rahmat’s home and abducted her while she was sleeping with her children. The Taliban then contacted her family, instructing them not to inform anyone of the kidnapping and not to publish the news on social media, promising her release by 10 AM.

Desperate to find his daughter, Mrs. Rahmat’s father rushed to Kabul from Herat province. Upon arrival, he contacted the National Intelligence Unit (Directorate 40), only to be told by the Taliban that they had no knowledge of her whereabouts. However, after her husband, Mohammed Rahed, publicized the news on Facebook, the Taliban finally acknowledged that they had abducted her. They offered to release her on the condition that she leave Kabul and stop teaching young girls. She was to go to the Shendand district of Herat province, accompanied by her father, and was warned not to raise her voice.

It’s worth noting that this is not the first time Mrs. Rahmat has been harassed by the Taliban. A month prior, she was summoned by the 5th district of Kabul Police department for allegedly gathering women to protest for women’s rights. They confiscated her national ID card and passport, only returning the former, which later expired, causing her eVisa of Iran to lapse.

The abduction of Mrs. Rahmat is just one example of the Taliban’s brutal oppression of women and their denial of the basic human right to education. Women and girls are not only banned from going to school, but they are also prohibited from participating in any economic or social activities outside their homes without a male guardian. The Taliban’s strict interpretation of Islamic law has stripped women of their freedom and subjected them to a life of slavery. The international community has condemned the Taliban’s actions, and various organizations are calling for immediate action to protect women’s rights in Afghanistan. However, the Taliban remain defiant and continue to impose their strict laws. The tragic story of Mrs. Zarifa Rahmat is a stark reminder of the atrocities that Afghan women face daily, and the urgent need for action to protect their rights.

The Taliban’s rise to power has caused immeasurable suffering to the people of Afghanistan, especially women and children. The international community must take a stand against this barbaric regime and work to protect the rights of Afghan women and girls. The kidnapping of Mrs. Zarifa Rahmat is a tragic and heartbreaking reminder of the horrors that Afghan women endure under the Taliban’s oppressive rule.

156,Thailand,Thailand: young WHRD summoned on royal defamation,17/02/2023,"A 14-year-old girl became the youngest person to be charged with royal defamation after she received a police summons following a complaint filed against her by a royalist activist.

Thanalop (last name withheld), 14, was summoned by Samranrat Police Station to report on 15 February after she was accused of royal defamation by royalist activist Anon Klinkaew, head of the ultra-royalist group People’s Centre to Protect the Monarchy.

The summons does not say why Thanalop is charged, but states that the cause of the complaint was an incident that occurred around the Giant Swing in Bangkok’s old town on 13 October 2022.

Thanalop, who calls herself “Comrade Sleepless” (สหายนอนน้อย), said that she initially received a summons dated 23 January, but certain details in it were wrong, so the family sent it back to the police for correction. She then received another summons last Tuesday (7 February).

The 14-year-old said that she is not concerned about being charged, but is more worried about her education, so she will ask the police to postpone her meeting. She said that her family is worried, but is going to let her decide what to do for herself.

She also said that she was harassed by police officers three times before she received an official summons. On 20 October 2022, an officer visited her house and told her family that she should be taken to see a psychiatrist.

Another officer came to visit the family again on 7 November 2022. Thanalop said that the officer spoke to her father, telling him that charges would be pressed against her. She also said that the officer spoke badly to her father, telling him that it would be better to commit suicide than to have a child like her.

On the same day, an officer tried to visit her at school, but Thanalop said the school refused to let them see her.

According to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR), at least 18 people under the age of 18 have been charged with royal defamation since 2020.

Thanalop said that, for her, the royal defamation law is problematic in that it carries a disproportionately severe penalty, while anyone can file a complaint against anyone else. She sees it as a law to silence people and violate people’s freedom.

She calls on political parties to back the repeal of the royal defamation law rather than proposing amendments to it. She said she is concerned that, if the law is not repealed, it can later be amended again and the penalty may become more severe, and said that it would be most benefit to the people to repeal it.

“Amending [the royal defamation law] is not the best for the people, but repealing it would be best for the people. If any political party gets elected to parliament, I want the parties to be clear about repealing Section 112,” she said.

The 14-year-old also said that she would like to back the call for the release of political prisoners and the demands for judicial reform issued by monarchy reform activists Tantawan Tuatulanon and Orawan Phuphong and the activist group Thaluwang. She said that there is not enough attention paid to the issue after members of parliament spoke about it during a parliamentary debate and wanted to call attention to it.",Freedom of assembly
157,China,China: demonstrators met with police violence,18/02/2023,"Thousands of people took to the streets of two Chinese cities – Wuhan and Dalian – on Wednesday in an ongoing protest over major cuts to their medical benefits, according to local residents and video footage posted to social media.

Video clips uploaded to social media showed crowds singing the communist anthem ""The Internationale"" under a traffic overpass in Zhongshan Park and along Jiefang Avenue in the central city of Wuhan.

Similar scenes unfolded in the People’s Square in the northeastern port city of Dalian, according to the Twitter account ""Mr. Li is not your teacher"" using the handle @whyyoutouzhele.

Other clips showed a crowd of older people facing off with ranks of uniformed police officers three or four deep who linked arms and started shoving the crowd slowly to make it pull back.

In one clip, an elderly man is seen lying on the ground with his head and legs propped up while people boo and shout at the police.

The protests were a continuation of an earlier rally outside municipal government headquarters in Wuhan on Feb. 8 against the slashing of medical payouts under an insurance scheme offered to retired employees of state-owned enterprises.

Zero-COVID policy drains coffers

They come after warnings from the central government in Beijing that it won’t be bailing out cash-strapped local governments, whose coffers have been drained by three years of President Xi Jinping’s zero-COVID policy, which ended in December.

Wuhan-based rights activist Zhang Hai said the demonstration there had gone ahead on Wednesday after a smaller protest outside government headquarters last week had failed to elicit a response from officials, and had taken place despite tight security measures.

""The government has been warning people not to go to Zhongshan Park or Shouyi Road since yesterday evening,"" Zhang told Radio Free Asia. ""A lot of residential communities were under lockdown this morning, but a lot of people still turned out nonetheless.""

""They are planning to march over by the Yangtze River Bridge after this rally,"" he said.

Zhang said police had responded by shutting down subway stations and cell phone masts serving the area.

""At the same time [as shutting subway stations], they have shut off the mobile phone signal, and they are making the crowd disperse,"" he said. ""People at the scene say they have detained quite a few people already.""

A person shooting footage of the crowd at the park gate said police were trying to get everyone to go inside Zhongshan Park.

""There were policemen everywhere and plainclothes [state security police] standing at the gate of the park,"" the person comments.

Detained at home

Wuhan resident Zhang Qiang said many other people had been detained in their homes to prevent them from protesting in the first place.

""A lot of people have been confined to their homes by stability maintenance,"" Zhang Qiang said. ""I have been roped in too.""

""The police are out in force around Zhongshan Park and Jiefang Avenue,"" he said.

A protester who gave only the surname Zhou said the cuts to medical benefits affect everyone, not just retired workers.

""People who are paying out 400 yuan a month are getting nothing back from the government now,"" he said. ""So they can't buy their medication.""

""They used to get more than 100 yuan a month [as a cash benefit] that they could use to buy medicines [over the counter], but now they're insisting we go to a hospital clinic -- they won't give us money to buy them from the pharmacy any more,"" Zhou said.

Wuhan businessman Ma Yongnian said he was in a similar situation.

""There are tens of thousands of people blocking the streets,"" Ma said, adding that similar changes were rolled out in the southern city of Guangzhou recently, but were withdrawn following major public opposition.

""Guangzhou withdrew this policy, but Wuhan is insisting on it,"" Ma said. 

He said hospital visits require a higher co-pay than pharmacies, putting medicines beyond the reach of many retirees.

""I'm affected by this too ... I can only claim 50% of fees in the top three hospitals, and there's an excess of 700 yuan before reimbursements even start,"" Ma said.

‘Rise up! Rise up!’

Meanwhile,  a person filming outside municipal government headquarters in Dalian said the large crowd in People's Square was there to ""present their demands"" to the authorities.

""They're all older men and women,"" the person comments on the video clip posted to Twitter by user @Pancho66196600, adding ""There are quite a few police here too,"" as the crowd starts singing the “March of the Volunteers,” China's national anthem.

""Rise up! Rise up!"" they sing, before the anthem fades on the winter air, and ""The Internationale"" takes its place, as some protesters heckle officials making their way into the government offices through the front gates. 

According to screenshots and photos posted by ""Mr. Li"" on Twitter, the protests went ahead in Wuhan despite reports that the authorities had tried to attract older people with a slew of community events for ""grandparents,"" and unconfirmed reports that universities had been closed for just one day on Feb. 15.

Public transportation companies had also issued warnings to employees of a ""major demonstration,"" according to a screenshot posted by the account.

In Dalian, protesters on People's Square also chanted the name of the city's mayor, the account said.

People in China frequently challenge those in power, despite nationwide measures aimed at nipping popular protest in the bud, the U.S.-based think tank Freedom House reported in November 2022.

159,Viet Nam,Vietnam: social media activist sentence upheld,18/02/2023,"Background

Dang Nhu Quynh is a well-known Facebooker who works and lives in Hanoi. Prior to arrest, he was running a Facebook account with more than 317,000 followers which focuses on social, political and economic issues in Vietnam.
History of Activism

According to State media, in 2020, Dang Nhu Quynh was summoned by the Hanoi police for his Facebook posts discussing Covid issues in Vietnam.



Details of Imprisonment

On April 12, 2022, Dang Nhu Quynh was arrested for allegedly posting “unverified information"" on his Facebook account. He was charged under Article 331 of the 2015 Criminal Code for “abusing democratic freedoms.""

According To An Xo, a spokesman for the Ministry of Public Security, Quynh was accused of using social media to post articles and “unverified information"" about certain individuals and businesses in finance, the stock market, and real estate. Quynh's actions  “negatively affected the state’s finance and stock market,” Xo said. 


Prior to arrest, Dang Nhu Quynh had recently posted several articles about the cases of finance mogul Trinh Van Quyet, chairman of FLC Group who had been arrested for stock market manipulation, and Do Anh Dung, the chairman of property developer Tan Hoang Minh Group who was arrested for bond-issuance fraud. In the posts, Quynh predicted that the government would continue prosecuting persons and company leaders that are guilty of similar crimes.


October 2022:

On October 27, a Hanoi court sentenced Dang Nhu Quynh, a 42-year-old Facebooker with over 300,000 followers, to two years in prison for “abusing democratic freedoms.” Prosecutors said that on April 2 Quynh posted information about Do Anh Dung, chairman of the joint stock company Tan Hoang Minh, claiming that Dung was being criminally investigated. However, it was not until April 5 that Dung’s investigation was revealed by police. The state further alleged that Quynh later posted unsubstantiated news about an investigation against Nguyen Van Tuan, chairman of joint stock companies Gelex and Viglacera, causing the share prices for these companies to drop precipitously, and leading to a loss in capitalization of 11,000 billion dong (US $500 million). Quynh was ultimately not charged for his posts about Do Anh Dung since the latter was under investigation anyway. However, according to prosecutors, Quynh allegedly admitted in court that his posts on Nguyen Van Tuan were just speculation on his part and done only to gain likes.

43-year-old Mr Quynh, owner of a Fb account with over 300,000 followers, had his 2-year jail sentence upheld on 14 Feb , by Hanoi court.",Right to liberty and security
160,Malaysia,Malaysia: WHRD threatened with legal action,18/02/2023,"A human rights activist will be charged tomorrow over a social media post on the mistreatment of refugees at detention centres, barely a year after she had the same charge dismissed by the High Court.

Heidy Quah said she would be charged at the cyber crimes court tomorrow morning.

In a Facebook post, Quah said she would be charged for allegedly using the internet with the intention to offend and annoy.

“This police report was filed against me by our government of Malaysia.”

The last time Quah was charged, she was granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal as the courts found the charges to be defective.

“But here I am, yet again. Being charged again.”

Quah then took a swipe at the current administration, saying that despite the change in the administration, some practices remained, specifically human rights defenders were still being prosecuted “for speaking the truth”.

She said while she was left shaken, she was determined to keep speaking up.

Quah also called on the government to reform Section 233 of the Communications and Multimedia Act (CMA), which she is being charged under, and pass a strong Whistleblowers Act.

“It’s time we investigate allegations, not whistleblowers.”

In 2021, Quah was slapped with a charge under Section 233(1)(a) of the CMA, with the prosecution contending that she uploaded the post on June 5, 2020, with the intention to insult others.

Hours after revealing that she would be charged over a social media post on the mistreatment of refugees at detention centres, human rights activist Heidy Quah said she had been informed that she would not be hauled to court after all.

Quah told FMT that she had just received a call from the investigating officer informing her that there was no longer a need for her to go to the cyber crimes court to face charges for allegedly using the internet with the intention to offend and annoy.

“I am not sure what caused the change, public pressure, our letters of appeal, or the different leaders within the government who have worked hard for a New Malaysia and want to do things right.

“I hope that this matter ends once and for all, and I will no longer be charged.”

She then thanked those who stood in solidarity with her.

Earlier this evening Quah revealed that she would be charged under Section 233 of the Communications and Multimedia Act (CMA).

The Kuala Lumpur High Court had last year granted her a discharge not amounting to an acquittal as they found the charges to be defective.

In 2021, Quah was slapped with one charge under Section 233(1)(a) of the CMA, with the prosecution contending that she uploaded the post on June 5, 2020, with the intention to insult others.",Right to healthy and safe environment
161,Afghanistan,"Afghanistan: media outlet raided, its staff beaten, vilified",18/02/2023,"The Taliban must allow Tamadon TV to operate freely and independently and end its campaign of harassment and violence against journalists, the Committee to Protect Journalists said Wednesday.

On Tuesday, February 14, about 10 armed Taliban members raided the headquarters of the privately owned broadcaster in Kabul, beat several staff members, and held them for 30 minutes, according to news reports and a journalist familiar with the case who spoke to CPJ on the condition of anonymity due to fear of reprisal.

That journalist said they did not know what led to the raid. Tamadon TV is predominantly owned and operated by members of the Hazara ethnic minority, and covers political and current affairs as well as Shiite religious programming. Hazara people have faced persecution and escalated violence since the Taliban’s takeover in August 2021.

“The Taliban’s raid of Tamadon TV and attacks on its employees show the group’s failure to abide by its professed commitment to freedom of expression in Afghanistan,” said Beh Lih Yi, CPJ’s Asia program coordinator. “Access to information in Afghanistan is critical. The Taliban must stop harassing journalists and stifling the work of the free press.”

While entering the broadcaster’s premises, Taliban members beat a security guard, two journalists, and two media workers, the journalist who spoke to CPJ said.

The Taliban members then pointed guns the station’s staff members, confiscated their mobile phones, and transferred them to a meeting room, where they were held for 30 minutes while Taliban members verbally harassed them, referring to one as an “infidel Hazara journalist,” according to that journalist.

Taliban members roamed around the headquarters, but it was not clear if they conducted any additional searches, and then confiscated two of the broadcaster’s vehicles when they left the scene.

162,Myanmar,Myanmar: community-based defender charged with terrorism,18/02/2023,"One of Myanmar’s leading Protestant activists has been charged under the country’s Counter Terrorism Law.

Family members said Dr. Hkalam Samson was charged under Section 52 (a) – which covers incitement to terrorism – by a court in Kachin State’s Myitkyina Prison on Tuesday.

His lawyer, Dong Nang, told RFA the court said it was charging him under terrorism laws because he had met officials of Myanmar’s National Unity Government, which was overthrown by the military in a Feb. 1, 2021 coup.

“They filed a new case for meeting with and praying for the NUG president, Minister of Natural Resources Dr. Tu Hkawng and Minister of Education Ja Htoi Pan in Lai Zar,” he said, referring to an area of Kachin controlled by the Kachin Independence Organization and its military wing the Kachin Independence Army.

Dr. Hkalam, 65, is a former president of the Kachin Baptist Convention and president of the Kachin National Consultative Assembly.

He had already been charged with criminal defamation and unlawful association with an illegal group, according to sources close to the secret court at Myitkyina Prison.

His lawyer told RFA that, with the addition of the new “terrorism” charge, Dr. Hkalam faces a maximum prison sentence of 13 years

Hkalam Samson was arrested at Mandalay International Airport on Dec. 4 on his way to medical treatment in Bangkok, Thailand, because his name was on a no-fly list. He was interrogated overnight at Central Regional Military Command headquarters.

The following day, authorities flew him back to Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin state, where he was again arrested.

Last month, his wife told RFA Dr. Hkalam was suffering from pneumonia and high blood pressure.

Zhon Nyoir, said she was worried about her husband's health because he had not been allowed to see his family since his arrest, and the family was not permitted to send him medicine or food.

At the time of his arrest Hkalam Samson still worked as an advisor for the Kachin Baptist Convention, which has about 400,000 members, most of whom are ethnic Kachin.

He was also president of the Kachin National Consultative Assembly, a group of local religious and political leaders who help foster communication between the Kachin Independence Organization, an ethnic Kachin political group, and the local community.

In October last year, he helped organize hospital treatment and funerals for people injured and killed in a junta airstrike on an annual concert hosted by the Kachin Independence Organization. The group's armed wing has been actively fighting against junta troops since the coup as well as training anti-regime People’s Defense Forces.

More than 60 people died during the attack, Kachin residents said at the time. 

In 2017, Dr. Hkalam visited the White House and thanked then-president Donald Trump for imposing travel bans on senior Myanmar military commanders involved in a violent crackdown on Rohingya Muslims that year. He also appealed to Trump to take action against religious persecution in Myanmar and to support the country’s transition to genuine democracy.

He was sued by Major Thu Aung Zaw of the junta’s Northern Regional Military Command, based in Kachin state, for speaking about Myanmar’s religious and human rights situation during the meeting but the case was later dropped.

Hkalam Samson’s next trial is scheduled for Feb. 21. Family members told RFA they had heard the junta is preparing to level further charges against him.",Right to liberty and security

The former student leader, who is better known as James in the activist community, received the sentence under Section 52b of Myanmar’s Counter-Terrorism Law, his wife, fellow activist Phyo Phyo Aung, told Myanmar Now.

“By adding more years to his sentence, the military council is not only systematically and politically oppressing a democratic activist, but also fabricating fake cases to charge him with terrorism,” she said.

She added that she still didn’t know if he would have to do hard labour or if time served would be deducted from his sentence.

Lin Htet Naing was arrested in Botahtaung Township in June of last year and later charged with incitement under Section 505a of the Penal Code.

On December 7, a prison court based in Yangon’s Kyauktada Township found him guilty of that charge and sentenced him to three years in prison.

The former ABFSU vice president was first imprisoned in 2008 after being arrested for his involvement in the monk-led Saffron Revolution of the previous year.

Following his release in 2011, he resumed his political activities, and was later handed six-month sentences in 2015 and 20202, with the latter ending just days before the military coup in February 2021.

On October 19 of last year, his mother, Kyi Kyi Myint, was among eight people killed when an explosive went off inside a reception area in Insein Prison, where Lin Htet Naing was being held.

Kyi Kyi Myint, who was known to many of her son’s activist friends as “Amay Kyi,” or Mother Kyi, was bringing him food at the time of the incident.

The former ABFSU vice president was first imprisoned in 2008 after being arrested for his involvement in the monk-led Saffron Revolution of the previous year.

Following his release in 2011, he resumed his political activities, and was later handed six-month sentences in 2015 and 20202, with the latter ending just days before the military coup in February 2021.

On October 19 of last year, his mother, Kyi Kyi Myint, was among eight people killed when an explosive went off inside a reception area in Insein Prison, where Lin Htet Naing was being held.

Kyi Kyi Myint, who was known to many of her son’s activist friends as “Amay Kyi,” or Mother Kyi, was bringing him food at the time of the incident.

165,Cambodia,Cambodia: leading independent news got licence revoked,13/02/2023,"The government this morning revoked the media operating licence of the Cambodian Center for Independent Media (CCIM), parent of the bilingual outlet Voice of Democracy (VOD), one of Cambodia’s few remaining independent media outlets.

The Ministry of Information revoked the licence after Prime Minister Hun Sen and his son, army commander Hun Manet, took issue with a 9 February VOD article that featured reactions from various people. This included a comment from government spokesperson Phay Siphan regarding the claim that Hun Manet had signed an agreement providing financial assistance to Türkiye. Both Manet and the prime minister later took to social media to deny that Manet had signed the document.

On 11 February, Hun Sen wrote on his Facebook page that VOD had 72 hours to apologise to the government and Hun Manet, or else he would direct the Ministry of Information to revoke VOD’s media operating licence. He later shortened this arbitrary deadline to expire on 10am on 13 February. Article 10 of the Press Law specifies the right of public figures who believe media have published false allegations with malicious intent to demand a retraction and sue in court to demand retractions, compensation, or both.

Following a meeting with Ministry of Information officials on 12 February, CCIM issued a letter addressed to Hun Sen expressing VOD’s “regret” and requesting “forgiveness [for] any unintentional wrongdoing”. VOD Khmer also published an article that evening outlining Hun Sen and Hun Manet’s denials.

Hun Sen rejected the apology via a Facebook post, stating that he was unable to accept the words “regret” and “forgiveness” in place of the word “apologise”, and ordered the Ministry of Information to revoke VOD’s licence. CCIM issued an additional letter of apology. Hun Sen again rejected the apology on Facebook in the early morning of 13 February. Several internet service providers had blocked access to VOD’s websites as of this morning.

VOD has become one of the most important independent media outlets in the country in recent years, publishing in Khmer and English. VOD journalists have written more than 60 stories over more than a year documenting widespread slave compounds where trafficked people are forced to conduct cyberscams. In August last year, five VOD journalists were detained and one was struck by the prime minister’s bodyguard unit while reporting on the recently deforested Phnom Tamao forest. The outlet also published dozens of stories from across the country documenting the repressive political space in the lead-up to the 2022 Commune Elections.

The shutdown of an independent media outlet is similar to the crackdown on journalists ahead of the last national election in 2018. In late 2017, the Cambodia Daily was shuttered over an arbitrary tax bill and in 2018 the Phnom Penh Post was sold to a firm with links to the government while facing pressure following a similar arbitrary tax bill. The government also shuttered dozens of radio frequencies carrying broadcasts of Radio Free Asia (RFA), Voice of America (VOA) and VOD.",Media freedom
166,Cambodia,Cambodia: independent news faces backlash after licence revoked (Update),27/02/2023,"Following the government-ordered shutdown of VOD last week, the outlet has been the subject of vulgar social media memes and its reporters continue to face personal attacks online and in government-aligned media.

Prime Minister Hun Sen has stated the VOD report which led him to revoke the outlet’s license last week was “fake news” and a political attack on the government.

“This is not the first time, and this time is too serious,” Hun Sen said Monday. “They intentionally attack both father [him] and son [Hun Manet] and destroy the government, you are trying to destroy me, it should be enough.”

Amidst the framing of VOD as fake news, Adhoc spokesperson Soeng Senkaruna said that there are few remaining media in Cambodia willing to report on negative issues. Freedom of press had been on the decline since the dissolution of the CNRP in 2017, he added. 

“Now we see that the situation has gone backwards, which is worrying,” he said. “We do not want to see images of restrictions on the press and civil society in a democratic society, and this event has made journalists fearful of fulfilling their role to serve society and the people.”

PM defends sexual harassment of journalist

On Monday, Hun Sen rebuked a group of more than 40 civil society organizations after they released a joint-statement last week condemning the sexual harassment of a female VOD reporter on social media.

The letter was addressed to the Minister of Information, Minister of Women’s Affairs, Minister of Culture and Fine Arts, and the Minister of Post and Telecommunications, urging the ministries to take action against social media personality Pheng Vannak for verbally attacking a female reporter. 

The letter stated that Pheng Vannak, who runs a self-titled social media news page, wielded misogynistic language against a female VOD reporter and demanded he apologize and attend gender sensitivity training. But the Prime Minister appeared to downplay Vannak’s comments.

“These NGOs were established only to oppose the government and not to do anything to protect women’s equality,” Hun Sen said during a February 20 speech to Phnom Penh university students. “When my sister [sister-in-law] died, she was insulted, my wife was insulted, my family was insulted, but you [NGOs] did not come out to defend, so next time don’t talk about double standards with me.”

Regarding the insults, Hun Sen was likely referring to statements made by exiled opposition figure Sam Rainsy, who mocked the death of the Prime Minister’s sister-in-law in early February.  

“I am waiting to see if all civil society organizations are taking action to protect my family as well,” Hun Sen said, warning he could order investigations into the NGOs’ financing.

“If it is necessary to audit [the NGOs] to find out where the money came from, we have the right to do so and the Ministry of Interior or the Anti-Corruption Unit could investigate,” he added.

While no other ministry responded directly to the civil society statement as of Monday, the Ministry of Women’s affairs released a statement Monday which urged civil society organizations to remain neutral and not pursue political interests.

“We call on civil society organizations to adhere to professional ethics and display impartiality in the conduct of their work, avoiding the application of biased and double standards,” the statement read.

Chim Channeang, secretary general of the Cambodian NGO Committee on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, signed the statement. She said the aims of the organizations signing the statement were not political.

“The role of civil society organizations is that we work in line with the government, our job is to work together as a government partner, and our role is to monitor the government,” she said. “For political parties, we do not interfere.”

Channeang said civil society organizations often receive money from abroad because Cambodia is a developing country with limited resources. She noted some government ministries also receive funding from foreign institutions. 

“It does not mean…doing daily activities to serve foreign interests or doing whatever the foreigner wants, we bring that money just to contribute to the government and it helps develop the country and benefit the poor or minority groups in our community,” she said.

She said that condemning the harassment of the female VOD journalist was not a political act but was intended to promote greater protection of women.

“We are not taking sides, but the fact is that the girl who reported the news was insulted, and it is such a serious threat to make,” Channeang said. “It destroys her reputation, especially it affects her mental health.”

Backlash against VOD reporters

While international media, foreign embassies and numerous Cambodians mourned and condemned the closure of VOD in a series of articles, editorials and social media posts, VOD staff came under attack on social media and in government-aligned news outlets.

The day VOD’s license was revoked on February ,13 a series of Twitter users — many appearing to be fake accounts — began posting identical cartoons and messages applauding VOD’s closure with the hashtag #VODshithead.

The Twitter accounts shared cartoons which portrayed VOD as a tool of foreign agents such as “foreign embassies” and “NGO[s]”. 

In one cartoon branded with the vulgar hashtag, a figure resembling the American icon Uncle Sam, in a tophat with the VOD logo, has a thought bubble attached reading “You must adhere to the strategies I have established” while painting Cambodia with paint labeled “human right” and “democracy.” 

A group of white journalists stands watching and one says “Each of us must follow our boss’s instructions regarding fake reports. Our boss gives us money and protects us.”

Few of the comments received more than 100 views, according to Twitter. 

The attacks on VOD reporters extended to government-aligned media.

Nargis Sadat was arrested while travelling in Pul-e-Surkh area of west Kabul on Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Sadat’s relatives told Rukhshana Media that she was not in good health and she had gone to the hospital for treatment. While on her way from the hospital to her sister’s house, she was detained at a checkpoint by Taliban forces in Kabul city’s district three.

The Taliban took Mrs. Sadat’s phone and went through it, then detained her on the grounds that it contained videos and photos of women protesting. Her family have not been allowed any information of her whereabouts.

171,China,China: anti-censorship blogger sentenced to seven years (Update),01/05/2023,"Reporters Without Borders (RSF) calls for the release of Chinese anti-censorship blogger Ruan Xiaohuan, better known in his country by the pseudonym “Program Think”, who was sentenced in February to a seven years prison sentence.

In the end of March, the wife of Ruan Xiaohuan, a blogger better known by the pseudonym “Program Think”, revealed that her husband was sentenced on 10 February by Shanghai No. 2 Intermediate Court to seven years in prison for ""inciting subversion of state power"". For twelve years, his personal blog gave advice on how to circumvent China’s Great Firewall of internet censorship, and exposed the regime's malpractices, including corruption. Ruan’s wife, despite the regime's pressure, made a difficult decision of making husband's case public, hoping the media exposure and public attention could help him.

In February, “Program Think”, 46, reappeared in trial for the first time since his forced disappearance in May 2021. He was convicted of having ""written more than 100 seditious and defamatory articles''. In addition to the harsh prison sentence, he was also deprived of his political rights for two years, while 20,000 renminbi (2,671 euros) worth of his property was confiscated. 

Ruan’s wife noticed that after nearly two years in secret detention, her husband's weight had halved and most of his hair had turned white. In early March, one of his lawyers was denied a prison visit, and notified that two state-assigned legal representatives had instead been appointed by the court. 

Mapping of corruption within the party

Launched in 2009, “Program Think” originally published technical advice on cybersecurity on his blog. In time, he started to translate foreign news, compiling data, and producing investigative and political content. In 2016, the blogger published a mapping of the connections and hidden wealth of high-ranking Chinese Communist Party members on Github, exposing the high level of corruption within the regime.

Since Chinese leader Xi Jinping took power in 2012, he began a crusade against journalism as revealed in RSF’s report The Great Leap Backwards of Journalism in China, which details Beijing’s efforts to control information and media within and outside its borders.

172,China,China: outspoken ethnic minority detained,27/02/2023,"Authorities in Xinjiang's regional capital Urumqi have detained an outspoken ethnic Kazakh musician, weeks after a Kazakhstan-based rights group warned that she was at risk of being hauled off to a psychiatric facility.

State security police in Urumqi's Shayibak district took Zhanargul Zhumatai, 47, away from her mother's house on Feb. 10, after she received a request for a ""media interview"" from someone claiming to be an Associated Press correspondent, according to the Kazahstan-based rights group Atajurt.

""State security police from the Shayibak branch of the Urumqi police department detained Zhanargul at 5.40 p.m. on Feb. 10,"" Atajurt spokesperson Nurbek told Radio Free Asia. ""She is gone.""

While Zhanargul's whereabouts are currently unclear, critics of the ruling Chinese Communist Party have repeatedly reported being held in psychiatric facilities despite having no diagnosis of mental illness.

A few days before she was detained, Zhanargul made a recording of a phone call with local state security police, who wanted to arrange a time to visit her at home.

""I don't want you people in my home,"" she says on the recording. ""I need to tell you straight, Officer Xu, I don't want anyone from the residential office, particularly not the neighborhood committee or the political and legal affairs commission, in my home either.""

""I don't want any of this. All I want is to be left in peace,"" she says.

But the police paid no heed to her request.

""The Xinjiang police called to threaten her at around 5.00 p.m. Urumqi time on Feb. 10, then they sent two ethnic Kazakh [officers] round,"" Atajurt founder Serikzhan Bilash said.

""They went to her mother's house and took Zhanargul Zhumatai away by force,"" he said.

Calls to the phone number given out by the purported AP journalist who contacted her on Feb. 8 resulted in a message saying the number was ""temporarily unavailable"" on Monday.

Land compensation

Her detention comes after she told Radio Free Asia in a Jan. 6 interview that she has been targeted by the authorities ever since she spoke out against government appropriation of ethnic Kazakh herding communities' land to make way for highways and hydropower stations around Urumqi.

Zhanargul spoke out after some herding communities received low compensation or none at all for the loss of their grazing lands, with some of the compensation money believed embezzled by local government officials.

""I wrote in a letter that the Urumqi county government has been suppressing herding communities and violating management regulations for national grasslands including resettlement subsidies that herding communities should get,"" she said in the interview with RFA Mandarin on Jan. 6.

""Urumqi officials sent me to a concentration camp, for so-called re-education ... because I refused to apologize,"" she said, adding that she was initially detained at the Urumqi No.3 Detention Center in 2017, before being transferred to one of the mass incarceration camps across Xinjiang which the ruling Chinese Communist Party says are for ""re-education"" and ""vocational training.""

She was put under huge pressure in the camp to write a confession detailing her ""extremist"" thoughts based on religious material on her cell phone, but continued to insist on her innocence. 

In the interview, Zhanargul described being made to sing revolutionary songs about the ""motherland"" and the Communist Party, as well as study the government's guidelines on religious ""extremism,"" which include a number of behaviors that are required or commonly regarded as desirable for Muslims, such as reading the Quran, or wearing head-coverings or beards.

She also said she was injected with unknown substances by medical staff during her time in the camp.

""I nearly fainted, had diarrhea and felt nauseous afterwards,"" she said. ""While they were injecting me, they laughed at my screams and asked if it hurt. I couldn't lift my arm for a couple of weeks after they injected me.""

Zhanargul said she lost nearly half her body weight during her stay, developed a number of health problems, and was denied permission to communicate with her family.

""When I went in there, I weighed 86 kilos, and I was a very strong woman,"" she said. ""By the time I got out in May 2019, I was a skeleton who weighed around 50 kilos. I almost died.""

Camps 'still there'

Serikzhan Bilash said little has changed in Xinjiang since Zhanargul's incarceration in the camp.

""The inhumane genocidal policies haven't changed; they're still being implemented in Xinjiang,"" he said. ""The Xinjiang concentration camps are still there.""

He said that while the Chinese government had released some ethnic Kazahs and allowed them to be reunited with their relatives in Kazakhstan, those who remain inside China remain ""under huge pressure.""

He said in a Jan. 6 interview that Zhanargul was ""extremely brave,"" as she had been one of the first camp detainees to speak out about her experiences while still in China.

""She is still in Xinjiang, so the state security police could make her disappear, fake her suicide, or put her in a psychiatric hospital at any time,"" he warned at the time. 

Zhanargul's detention came after U.S. lawmakers called on Washington to do more to enforce recent laws passed by U.S. lawmakers addressing the forced labor of the predominantly Muslim Uyghur minority group, who have made up the majority of detainees in the camps.

The government has detained large numbers of Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities simply for posting religious videos not approved by officials, or for possessing Qurans, prayer mats and traditional clothing, all of which have been described as evidence of ""extremism"" by Chinese police in recent years.

Sources estimate that Chinese authorities in Xinjiang have detained hundreds of ethnic Kazakhs in recent years, freezing their bank accounts and assets pending ""investigation,"" also for “extremist” behavior that includes normal Islamic practices.",Right to liberty and security

175,China,China: petitioners sent back to their home cities en masse,12/02/2023,"Chinese authorities are stepping up security measures ahead of next month’s annual parliamentary and advisory sessions in Beijing, detaining dozens of people coming to the capital with grievances and forcing them to go back home, Radio Free Asia has learned.

The moves come ahead of the country's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress. 

More than 30 petitioners from Shanghai were detained en route to Beijing by train in recent days, a petitioner who gave only the surname Zhou for fear of reprisals said. ""They have just started stability maintenance,"" Zhou said. ""They now need to know the whereabouts of every petitioner.""

""Anyone who goes to Beijing gets brought back – they brought back 30 to 40 people in the space of a week, because the Beijing and Tianjin police intercepted the train when it reached Beijing,"" Zhou said. ""They handed them straight over to the Shanghai representative office in Beijing.""

China's army of petitioners, who flood the ruling Chinese Communist Party's official complaints departments daily, frequently report being held in unofficial ""black jails,"" beaten, or otherwise harassed if they persist in a complaint beyond its initial rejection at the local level.

They are often escorted home forcibly by ""interceptors"" sent by their local governments to prevent negative reports from reaching the ears of higher authorities, where they face surveillance, violent treatment and possible detention on criminal charges, particularly during major political events or on dates linked to the pro-democracy movement.

The situation was also confirmed by a Beijing resident who gave only the surname Tang.

""They've started coming in from every locality and detaining people [from their jurisdictions],"" Tang said. ""They've already arrived from Jilin, Shenyang, Liaoning, while the ones from Ningxia started detaining people on the first and second day of Lunar New Year.""

The ruling Chinese Communist Party's advisory body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference kicks off its annual session this year on March 4, closely followed by the National People's Congress, where party leader Xi Jinping will likely be nodded through for a third term as president after abolishing term limits in 2018.

Tang, who rents out rooms to petitioners in Beijing, said police had come to her home to warn her not to do so ahead of the parliamentary sessions.

""The police came round five days ago and told me not to rent rooms to petitioners, or my ability to make a living could be affected,"" she said. ""More than a dozen people were taken away [on Thursday].""

""I had told 14 people they could stay with me, but they can't now.""

Tang said the measures were part of nationwide ""stability maintenance"" measures aimed at nipping any possible mass gatherings or protests of those with grievances against the government in the bud.

A petitioner who gave only the surname Zhang from the central city of Wuhan said petitioners are often classified as ""key"" individuals by police and targeted for stability maintenance, based on how much of a threat they could pose to public order.

They then impose restrictions on them, preventing them from going to Beijing, Zhang said. 

""I made a trip to [the central province of] Henan the day before yesterday,"" he said. ""I had been planning to continue north [to Beijing] but five individuals from my local police station contacted me by phone and asked me what I was up to in Henan.""

""They had very clear knowledge of my whereabouts and what I was doing.""

A petitioner surnamed Li said he and several others were taken away by police recently and had their retinas and voiceprints recorded on a police database.

177,China,China: ailing pro-democracy defender denied lawyer visit (Update),12/02/2023,"Ailing rights activist Huang Qi, who is serving a 12-year jail term in the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan for ""leaking state secrets,"" has once more been denied a visit from his lawyer, Radio Free Asia has learned.

Huang's lawyer turned up at Sichuan's Bazhong Prison on Wednesday in a bid to visit his client, but was turned away by the authorities, Huang's mother Pu Wenqing told friends via the WeChat messaging app on Wednesday evening.

Huang, now in his late fifties, has been identified by Paris-based press freedom group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) as one of 10 citizen journalists in danger of dying in detention.

He has repeatedly denied the charges against him and has refused to ""confess,"" making him vulnerable to mistreatment and deprivation of rights and privileges in prison.

Later, Bazhong municipal police officers followed up with a visit to the lawyer at his hotel, Pu wrote in comments seen by a person in Chengdu who declined to reveal their identity for fear of reprisals.

""The reason was that the last time a lawyer had visited [Huang], they took photos inside the prison and posted them online,"" the person told Radio Free Asia on Thursday.

""The lawyer checked into a hotel in Bazhong city on the night of Feb. 7, and four police officers from the local police station turned up there and harassed them,"" the person said.

An employee who answered the phone at the Bazhong Prison on Thursday hung up the phone as soon as they heard the name Huang Qi.

Further calls to the same number rang unanswered during office hours.

Calls to Pu's number also rang unanswered on Thursday.

Another friend of Huang's who asked to remain anonymous said Pu is currently under close surveillance, surrounded by officials and unable to leave her home.

""Huang Qi's lawyer has never met with her, and ... petitioners [fellow rights activists] have also been unable to visit her,"" the friend said.

Pu, who is in her late eighties, said she was told by her doctor in June 2022 that her lung cancer was spreading to her liver, and called on the ruling Chinese Communist Party to allow her to visit her son in prison before she dies.

She said at the time she was living under surveillance by the state security police, who insisted on escorting her to every medical appointment.

The last time she was able to speak with Huang via video call was Nov. 24, 2022, according to the overseas-based Chinese Human Rights Defenders network's Twitter account. A Jan. 28, 2022 meeting was abruptly cut off two minutes in, after she tried to discuss Huang's defense lawyers with him.

‘Leaking state secrets’

A court in the southwestern province of Sichuan handed down a 12-year jail term to Huang, a veteran rights activist and founder of the Tianwang rights website, on July 29, 2019.

Huang was sentenced by the Mianyang Intermediate People's Court, after it found him guilty of ""leaking state secrets overseas.""

Huang's lawyers and Pu have said all along that the case against Huang was a miscarriage of justice, even allowing for the traditionally harsh treatment of dissidents in China.

Chen Tianmao, a former police officer accused alongside Huang, has said the authorities in Sichuan's Mianyang city ""faked"" documents to use against Huang, as well as torturing Chen, Huang and a third defendant Yang Xiuqiong in a bid to force a ""confession"" out of them.

Chinese Human Rights Defenders tweeted on Nov. 24 that Huang had also submitted a number of official complaints over his case to the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate via the prison.

Huang's Tianwang website had a strong track record of highlighting petitions and complaints against official wrongdoing, and injustices meted out to the most vulnerable in society, including forced evictees, parents of children who died in the devastating 2008 Sichuan earthquake, and other peaceful critics of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.",Right to fair trial
178,Kazakhstan,Kazakhstan: independent media editor intimidated,12/02/2023,"The chief editor of the Ulysmedia.kz news website in Kazakhstan’s largest city, Almaty, says she received a box from unknown people that contained a hunk of meat and pictures of her children, a parcel she called a new attempt ""to intimidate"" her and her staff.

Samal Ibraeva told RFE/RL that the box was delivered to the website's office on February 8. She linked the box's delivery to the professional activities of her team, which she said has been the target of other intimidation attempts.

On January 18, Ulysmedia.kz had to suspend its operations following a hacking attack. Ibraeva said at the time that the attack was most likely linked to the website's work, adding that it had faced several previous similar attacks.

The incident comes at a time when the independent press in Kazakhstan is coming under pressure.

The Almaty-based Adil Soz (A Just Word) group, which monitors journalists' rights, said earlier that there have been at least five attacks against journalists in the Central Asian nation since January 1.

The subjects of the attacks, including Ulysmedia.kz, have been writing and reporting about Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine and the first anniversary of the violent dispersal of anti-government protests in Kazakhstan that turned into mass unrest that left at least 238 people, including 19 law enforcement officers, dead.

On January 20, presidential spokesman Ruslan Zheldibai said President Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev, who has initiated a series of changes since last year's deadly protests aimed at creating what he calls a ""new Kazakhstan,"" has ordered law enforcement to investigate each attack against journalists.

Ibraeva said to RFE/RL on February 8 that, despite the presidential order to investigate the attacks, it remains unclear who is behind the assaults.

International human rights watchdogs and the embassies of several Western nations have urged Kazakh authorities to investigate the attacks.",Right to healthy and safe environment
179,Philippines,Philippines: NGO faces further judicial harassment,18/02/2023,"

Human rights alliance Karapatan expressed support for the Rural Missionaries of the Philippines (RMP), as the missionary group faces another hearing of a civil forfeiture case filed by the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) at the Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 37 today, February 8, 2023. Karapatan joined calls by various faith-based and human rights organizations for the immediate dismissal of the charges against RMP.

Karapatan Secretary General said that the ongoing civil forfeiture and terrorism financing cases against RMP, which stem from fabricated testimonies, have resulted in the violation and arbitrary and unjust restriction of the rights of the RMP and the further deprivation of the impoverished and marginalized communities that the RMP serves.

Aside from the civil forfeiture case, sixteen individuals, including four nuns who are members of RMP, are facing non-bailable charges before an Iligan City court for alleged violation of Section 8 of Republic Act 10168 or the Terrorism Financing Prevention and Suppression Act of 2012 punishable with 40 years imprisonment, and a fine ranging from P500,000 to P1,000,000.

“We assail these moves as a prelude to the unjust and arbitrary designation of the RMP as ‘terrorist,’ following similar moves made against other individuals like Dr. Natividad Castro, a community doctor who has been servicing mostly Lumad and poor peasant communities in the Caraga region for decades. These measures are patently anti-poor,” slammed Palabay, citing the RMP’s more than 50 years of service to marginalized communities of farmers, indigenous people, fisherfolk and agricultural workers.

“The terrorist financing charges are reckless, false and baseless, since the RMP has consistently passed independent checks and reviews by strict and reputable funding agencies, including the European Union. Red-tagging, terrorist branding and hailing to court the real people’s heroes like the RMP nuns and development workers expose them to attacks and violations of their rights by State security forces and put their lives in danger,” Palabay stressed.

“Laws are clearly being weaponized against those critical of government policies, and those who fill the vacuum by providing much-needed services to the most severely neglected communities. The State must immediately cease and desist from this nefarious practice and provide support and encouragement instead of persecuting and prosecuting activists with lifelong pro-poor advocacies,” she added.

Karapatan today also joined protest actions at the Department of Justice calling for the resumption of peace talks between the National Democratic Front of the Philippines and the Philippine government and demanding the removal of the arbitrary terrorist designation by the Anti-Terrorism Council of the NDFP, the Communist Party of the Philippines and New People’s Army as well as individual peace consultants and Dr. Natividad Castro.

“The resumption of the peace talks, as well as the reaffirmation of and adherence to previously signed agreements such as the Comprehensive Agreement on the Respect for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law and the Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees, is the way to go in tackling the roots of the armed conflict, instead of the arbitrary, dangerous and erroneous designation by the ATC that leads to gross violations of international humanitarian law and threats to lives, security and liberty, as well as the right to due process ” she ended.

180,Pakistan,Pakistan: Journalist held in prison on unclear charges after being deported from Malaysia (Update),28/03/2023,"Reporters Without Borders (RSF) calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Syed Fawad Ali Shah, a Pakistani journalist also known as Fawad Shah, who was deported from Malaysia last August despite having refugee status there, and who is now being held in a prison in Peshawar, in northern Pakistan, on unsubstantiated charges.

Shah disappeared after being sent back to Pakistan but the “Where is Syed Fawad Ali Shah?” appeal issued by RSF in January3 bore fruit when he was officially transferred on 8 February to Adiala Jail, the main prison in Rawalpindi, the twin city of the capital, Islamabad. He was moved from there to Peshawar ten days later.

It has emerged that, before his transfer to Adiala Jail, Shah spent five and a half months held incommunicado in one of the cells of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), a counter-espionage agency attached to the interior ministry. 

No evidence-
RSF has seen a copy of the January 2020 police report, known as a First Information Report (FIR), that accuses Shah of posting “false, frivolous and fake information” online in violation of sections 20 and 24 of the 2016 Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA). Filed by an interior ministry official in Peshawar, the city where Shah is now being held, the FIR also cites sections 186, 500 and 506 of the penal code regarding “defamation” and “intimidation” of officials.

“The First Information Report accusations against Syed Fawad Ali Shah are supported by absolutely no legally valid evidence, which means this journalist should not be in a prison. Furthermore, according to the latest information available to us, his state of health is quite alarming after six months in prison cells. To respect the rule of law and on humanitarian grounds, we urge interior minister Rana Sanaullah Khan to order his immediate and unconditional release and to allow him to leave Pakistan."" Daniel Bastard
(Head of RSF’s Asia-Pacific desk)

Shah’s wife, who prefers not to be named, was allowed to visit him in the Peshawar prison on 21 February. “He has become very weak and his whole body was shaking,” she said. “Seeing his condition, he has been tortured a lot. His mental state is very bad.”

Warning to Pakistani journalists based abroad-
RSF received no response when it asked the interior minister’s office to provide more information about the First Information Report accusations against Shah and about the conditions in which he is being held.

Shah fled Pakistan in 2011 after being abducted and tortured by members of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Pakistan most feared intelligence agency. Pakistan’s counter-espionage agencies had been trying to have him repatriated ever since the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) granted him refugee status in Malaysia in 2014.

RSF has seen a disturbing surge in incidents targeting Pakistani journalists based abroad in recent years. A year ago, a court in London confirmed that Ahmad Waqas Goraya, a Pakistani journalist and blogger based in the Netherlands, had been a target when it convicted Muhammad Gohir Khan, a British citizen of Pakistani origin, of conspiring to murder him.

Abducted and tortured-
The body of Balochistan Times editor Sajid Hussain was retrieved from the River Fyris in central Sweden in April 2020. In July 2020, RSF revealed the existence of an internal memo to Pakistan’s intelligence agencies providing a list of journalists based abroad to be kept under surveillance and, if necessary, “approached through proper channels” to get them to refrain from further anti-Pakistan “rhetoric.”

The many cases of journalists being subjected to intimidation, abduction and torture is one of the main reasons why Pakistan is now ranked 157th out of 180 countries in RSF's World Press Freedom Index.",Right to fair trial

181,Indonesia,Indonesia: Intimidation against a survivor of past human rights violation in Aceh,28/03/2023,"Less than one month after President Jokowi expressed his acknowledgment and regret for 12 gross human rights violations in Indonesia. On January 11, 2023, there were at least two events that were the opposite of what was expected. Hope for survivors, families of victims and the public in general to feel safe from the potential repetition of serious crimes against human rights – as stated in Presidential Decree No. 17/2022 concerning the establishment of a Team for the Non-Judicial Resolution of Past Serious Human Rights Violations. The two events in question were intimidation of survivors of the Simpang Kertas Kraft Aceh Incident (Simpang KKA) and the hacking of the WhatsApp accounts of at least five activists from the Kamisan Action in Medan on 8-9 February 2023 and banning the Kamisan Action from 9 February 2023 on the grounds that the President was coming to commemorate National Day. National Press in the capital of North Sumatra Province.

On 7 February 2023, a survivor of the KKA Simpang Incident felt intimidation by a number of parties from the local police and military. Apart from being called numerous times to request data on the victims of the KKA Simpang Incident, a group of people suspected of being members of the Lhokseumawe Police and the Dewantara Police came to his house and asked him and other victims of the KKA Simpang Incident not to demonstrate and carry attributes that were ""against"" when President Joko Widodo visited Aceh to inaugurate a fertilizer factory on 10 February 2023. The next day, 8 February 2023 a group of people suspected of being Babinsa came to his house and said that they did this because they were ordered by their superiors. This of course does not show the professionalism of the Indonesian police and army, if it cannot be further said as thuggery. In the context of resolving serious crimes against human rights, the parties authorized to obtain information within the framework of investigations, investigations and preparations for court proceedings are Komnas HAM and the Attorney General's Office, not the police and military. Apart from that, such actions also have the potential to re-traumatize the survivors and the victims' families who have deep trauma from the activities of the apparatus during the implementation of the Military Operations Area and Martial Law on Bumi Rencong.

This intimidation should be considered as continued insensitivity, considering that since mid-2022, the Province of Aceh has been led by an Acting Governor who has a military career background, namely Major General TNI (Purn.) Achmad Marzuki. Evaluation and correction of officials involved in a number of serious crimes against human rights in Aceh that have not been held because there is no Human Rights Court is also a valid factor for survivors' concerns about intimidation by security forces.

The second incident of intimidation occurred on 8-9 February 2023. President Jokowi's working visit which took place on Thursday, 9 February 2023 coincided with the day of the Medan Kamisan Action. Human rights activists and citizens who used their rights to peacefully assemble and express their opinions were terrorized and silenced. The mass of the Kamisan Action, which numbered only a dozen people, was surrounded by hundreds of police who were on guard, experienced intimidation and the props for the action were taken by force. The identity of the party who contacted the North Sumatra Regional Police also showed excessive and unnecessary effort so that it was clear that the wrong step of restriction on the implementation of the Medan Kamisan Action was clearly visible.

The pattern of human rights violations in the two incidents above can be seen related to President Jokowi's planned visit to a number of places. Intimidation and repression of freedom of expression and opinion actually occurred in the locations that President Jokowi would visit.

Even though there were no direct instructions from President Jokowi, the existence of a ""superior order"" in the two incidents above is a form of wrong action by the TNI and POLRI. Even though the PPHAM Team's recommendation that Jokowi himself had accepted had mentioned TNI and POLRI reforms both structurally and culturally. The methods of intimidation using the Police and the TNI are New Order styles which no longer have a place in Reformation. President Jokowi and his staff must pay attention to this fact in order to ensure that gross human rights violations do not recur for the people of Indonesia.",Right to healthy and safe environment
182,China,China: trial against 47 pro-democracy defenders begins in Hong Kong,07/02/2023,"The trial of 47 of Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy figures begins Monday, in the largest prosecution under a national security law that has crushed dissent in the city.

The proceedings are expected to last more than four months, and the defendants face up to life imprisonment if convicted.

Those on trial represent a cross-section of Hong Kong's opposition -- including legal scholar Benny Tai, former lawmakers Claudia Mo, Au Nok-hin and Leung Kwok-hung, and democracy activists Joshua Wong and Lester Shum.

They are charged with ""conspiracy to commit subversion"" for organising an unofficial primary election.

According to authorities, they were trying to topple Hong Kong's government, while the defendants say they are being prosecuted for practising normal opposition politics.

Their stated aim was to win a majority in the city's partially elected legislature, which would allow them to veto budgets and potentially force the resignation of Hong Kong's leader.

That vote was ultimately scrapped and Beijing installed a new political system that strictly vets who can stand for office.

The 47 were charged en masse under the national security law that China imposed in 2020, after huge and often violent pro-democracy protests.

Beijing says the law was needed to curb unrest, but critics say the crackdown on the opposition has eviscerated the city's autonomy and political freedoms.

- Fair or farce? -

Dennis Kwok, a former opposition lawmaker who now lives in the United States, described the trial as ""a complete farce"".

""Subversion is a crime that used to require someone who threatened to use violence... to overturn the regime,"" Kwok told AFP.

""It doesn't include people who simply run for office and pledge to use their public office to force the government to respond to the demands of the people they represent.""

Prosecutors and government supporters see the unofficial primary differently.

""I would assume if your intent is to bring down the government, then that must be unlawful,"" said Ronny Tong, a veteran lawyer.

- A city transformed -

While Hong Kong has never been a democracy, it enjoyed far more freedoms than mainland China.

The national security law has transformed the city's political landscape as well as its common law legal traditions, refashioning Hong Kong's courts to more closely resemble the mainland's.

The law also empowered China's security apparatus to operate openly in the city.

Judges who sit on national security cases are handpicked by the city's leader and there has not yet been a trial in front of a jury.

Most of the defendants in this case -- 34 out of 47 -- have been jailed for almost two years. The few granted bail have to abide by strict conditions, including speech restrictions.

Legal and political analysts are watching the trial closely.

Eric Lai, at Georgetown University's Center for Asian Law, said Hong Kongers will be paying attention to ""how the prosecution defines an ordinary civil society event as a criminal act"".

While Hong Kong has never been a democracy, it enjoyed far more freedoms than mainland China.

The national security law has transformed the city's political landscape as well as its common law legal traditions, refashioning Hong Kong's courts to more closely resemble the mainland's.

The law also empowered China's security apparatus to operate openly in the city.

Judges who sit on national security cases are handpicked by the city's leader and there has not yet been a trial in front of a jury.

Most of the defendants in this case -- 34 out of 47 -- have been jailed for almost two years. The few granted bail have to abide by strict conditions, including speech restrictions.

Legal and political analysts are watching the trial closely.

Eric Lai, at Georgetown University's Center for Asian Law, said Hong Kongers will be paying attention to ""how the prosecution defines an ordinary civil society event as a criminal act"".

Sixteen of the 47 have pleaded not guilty.

At least three will testify against their peers as prosecution witnesses, the court has been told.",Right to political participation
183,Philippines,Philippines: academic and unionist arrested,12/02/2023,"The arrest of professor Dr. Melania Flores in her house inside the University of the Philippines in Diliman, Quezon City is in violation of the UP-Department of Interior and Local Government Accord.

This is the statement of UP Faculty Regent Carl Marc Ramota as he condemned the arrest of Flores this morning, Feb. 6.

The 1992 UP-DILG Accord prohibits uniformed personnel from entering the UP campus without coordination or notice to the administration of UP Diliman.

In a statement, Ramota said there was no prior coordination with the Diliman authorities on the planned arrest of Flores. The four arresting officers were not in uniform and reportedly introduced themselves as employees of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD).

The Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) said that when the purported DSWD employees were inside Flores’s house, an arrest warrant was shown to her without explaining the case and immediately arrested her. Flores was being accused of alleged violation of Social Security System remittance. She was brought to Camp Karingal in Quezon City.

Flores is the immediate past president of the All U.P. Academic Employees Union (AUPAEU) and a faculty member of UP Departamento ng Filipino at Panitikan ng Pilipinas.

She was released after posting P72,000 ($1,314) bail this afternoon.

Ramota asserted that the arrest violated both the UP-DILG accord and Flores’s Miranda rights.

He added that the arrest comes in the wake of a series of documented cases of harassment and intimidation against UP constituents, the latest being the abduction of UP Cebu lecturer Armand Dayoha and UP alumna Dyan Gumanao last January 10.

Ramota pointed out that this incident and the Cebu abduction highlight the need for the institutionalization of a mechanism for monitoring and quick response against rights violations.

He urged the University “to use its full administrative and legal machinery to uphold and protect its constituency from intrusion, and keep its campuses a safe haven for political thought and action.”

The AUPAEU vehemently condemned the arrest of its former officer.

The union said that Flores did not receive any complaint or subpoena against her.

They also assailed the CIDG for pretending to be employees of the DSWD to arrest Flores.

“It is a clear violation of the UP-DILG Accord of 1992. This dirty tactic by the CIDG is a method to intimidate and harass unionists and patriotic academic workers,” the union said in a statement.",Right to liberty and security
184,Maldives,Maldives: two media worker injured for covering a protest,12/02/2023,"Two journalists from Channel 13 covering the opposition protest were injured on Monday, with one sustaining serious injures.

The opposition coalition gathered in Sosun Magu in Malé, close to the parliament, in protest of the presidential address given by President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih. A large number of police were deployed onto the roads in riot gear to control the crowd; they attempted to break up the demonstration with force.

During this altercation, a videographer and photographer wearing their press passes were injured.

Hassan Shaheed, one of the injured journalists, was taken to ADK Hospital for treatment. According to the Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM), he sustained brain and spinal injury. His family had even started the process of transferring him to a medical facility in Sri Lanka for further treatment.

The police used pepper spray to stop the crowd from reaching the parliament.

At the parliament's opening, the opposition lawmakers protested within the chambers before President Solih delivered his address.

According to the Mihaaru News journalist on scene, the two journalists from Channel 13 were pushed back and fell down when the police, armed with protective shields, moved forward. They were further affected when the police used pepper spray to control the crowd.

Images showing both journalist on the road were circulating online; one of the journalists appear to be unconscious in the photos. Another Channel 13 reporter claimed that the reporter who fainted on site had recently undergone major surgery and was still recovering from it.

PPM Spokesperson Heena said 11 people have been detained by the police so far in connection with the opposition protest. Four people were rushed to a hospital for injuries sustained during the protest.",Right to healthy and safe environment
185,Cambodia,Cambodia: 900 workers not allowed to resume working,12/02/2023,"Around 900 workers at a Phnom Penh factory said the owner won’t let them resume work after a two-month suspension and alleged most of the suspended workers support a pro-worker union.

Of the around 1,700 workers at Zhen Tai factory in Phnom Penh’s Sen Sok district, around 900 were affected by a factory-requested suspension because there was a drop in orders, said Kim Sophen, president of the Workers’ Spirit Union at the factory.

Sophen said workers were paid $30 a month for the two months and returned to work on Monday but were not allowed into the factory nor were they told if the suspension was extended. They protested outside the factory and demanded to return to work, suggesting a rotation policy with workers still working at the factory.

“If there is no order or work, the factory should allow workers who have been suspended for two months to resume their work and move those who are working to relax in order to help everyone survive,” he said.

Mech Seanghai, deputy president of the union, said she had worked at the factory for 11 years and alleged that most of the suspended workers were supportive of the union.

She said the curtailed pay given to suspended workers was making it hard to live.

“The cost of renting a room alone is between $40 and $100. And the cost of food is also increasing. Therefore, $30 is definitely hard for us to make a living. We also need money to spend on our children’s studies and to pay back our debt to the bank,” she said.

Sin Thy, the factory’s deputy director of administration, declined to comment and directed questions to head of administration Oun Sophea, who could not be reached.

Vong Sovann, the Labor Ministry’s deputy director for dispute resolution, said the ministry had yet to hear from the factory but it was his understanding that the factory would continue the suspensions.

“I looked at the suspension document, the factory said it will suspend work until February 6. So, we will wait and see. We contacted the factory but they have not responded yet,” he said.

According to Sophen, Zhen Tai previously threatened the union when it sought to protect workers’ benefits when the suspensions were first announced, suing three union representatives. An investigating judge at Phnom Penh Municipal Court issued a summons calling Sophen, Kum Vandeth, secretary of the union, and Seanghai, for questioning on December 19, 2022.

The summons accused the three union representatives of leading workers to protest and asked for $37,500 in damages.",Freedom of assembly

186,India,India: media worker killed after reporting on land grabbing,12/02/2023,"Maharashtra-based journalist Shashikant Warishe has been killed by a local realty broker hours after releasing a report alleging the broker had engaged in illegal land grabbing and was connected to senior Indian politicians. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) strongly condemns this brutal killing of a journalist for their reporting and urges the authorities to bring all perpetrators to swift justice.

On February 6, broker Pandharinth Amberkar allegedly drove his black Mahindra Thar SUV into Warishe on the Rajapur highway in the Konkan Region of Maharashtra. Warishe was struck down by the vehicle, which Amberkar was seen to be driving, while near a petrol pump and was  was dragged under the vehicle for several meters, sustaining fatal injuries.

The journalist was taken to the Civil Hospital in Ratnagiri, and then to the City Hospital, but despite medical efforts Warishe died on the morning of February 7. He is survived by his mother, wife and 19-year-old son.

The journalist had previously published a series of reports in the local Mahanagari Times, highlighting local opposition to the controversial establishment of the Ranagri Refinery & Petrochemicals LTD in Barsu. His most recent article, which was published just five hours before the fatal incident, accused Amberkar of being a ‘criminal’ and revealed the relationship between the land broker and senior politicians, including Narendra Modi and Maharashtra state leadership.

The incident has inspired condemnations from human rights organisations, press freedom advocates, and local environmental activists, who have condemned the incident, and called for an investigation into the circumstances of Warishe’s killing.

According to local police, Amberkar was arrested on the evening of February 7 and will remain in custody until February 14. He has been charged with ‘culpable murder’, though activists have demanded the registration of murder charges against him.",Right to life
187,Kazakhstan,Kazakhstan: son of media worker attacked,12/02/2023,"Police in Kazakhstan’s largest city, Almaty, have launched a probe into an alleged attack against the son of noted journalist Dinara Egeubaeva by an unknown person armed with a pistol.

The Almaty city police department said on February 6 that it had registered Egeubaeva's complaint and started an investigation into it.

Egeubaeva said a day earlier that her son was approached by a man with a pistol in his hand late in the evening and managed to escape an attack by fleeing and then hiding in a residential building.

Egeubaeva insists that the attack was linked to her professional activities.

Last month, unknown attackers broke a window of Egeubaeva's car before setting the vehicle on fire. Egeubaeva linked that attack with her professional activities as well.

Police said later that they apprehended a group of teenagers suspected of the arson attack, but it remains unclear who ordered the assault.

The Almaty-based Adil Soz (A Just Word) group, which monitors journalists' rights, said last month that at least five journalists have been attacked in Kazakhstan since January 1.

Egeubaeva has been writing and reporting about the first anniversary of the violent dispersal of anti-government protests that turned into mass disorder and left at least 238 people, including 19 law enforcement officers, dead.

She has also announced her decision to take part in early parliamentary elections scheduled for March 19.

Senior Counsel Chaminda Athukorala appearing on behalf of the suspect stated that his client had been summoned by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) unofficially without a properly written document.

He further noted that his client sent an email to the Criminal Investigations Department mentioning his arrival to the country. He also pointed out that the charges filed against his client did not fall under the Computer Crimes Act. The Magistrate fixed further inquiries for May 17.

189,Myanmar,Myanmar: community-based defenders protesting eviction are threatened,27/02/2023,"Ever since soldiers forced them out of their Yangon home in November, Ma Hla, her husband and their two kids have tried to survive in a one square-meter (10-square-foot) dormitory room.

But with jobs tough to come by in Myanmar’s fragile post-coup economy, even the modest 50,000-kyat ($24) monthly rent is proving too much for the family, says Ma Hla, whose husband has been unable to find consistent work. 

Desperate, Ma Hla this month joined a group of about 100 other evicted villagers who gathered along a nearby road ward to demand they be allowed to return to their homes.

In all, about 40,000 residents from the five neighborhoods that make up Mingalardon township in Myanmar’s largest city – San Thamar Di, Myal Myan Aung, Gon Nyin Ni, Dhamma Par La and Myawaddy Site Khin – were kicked out. 

Soldiers have responded by firing warning shots and hiring thugs who wave swords to warn protesters against persisting with their demands, residents said. 

“They threatened us saying, ‘Do you guys have nothing else to do? Don’t come and mess with us. Just get lost right now, or we are going to arrest you all right away,’” Ma Hla told Radio Free Asia.

Her name and the names of other residents quoted in this story have been changed to protect them from retribution for speaking out.

“They threatened in many various ways. They even fired six times in the early morning to scare us away,” Ma Hla said. “Nobody dared to gather on that day except me. We are scared, but I went there to demand as I am really in trouble. I even risk my life to demand our land for the future of my two kids.”

1.2 million displaced

The military claims it owns the land and has set about demolishing the homes that in some cases the displaced families had lived in for decades.

Some residents had settled in the area in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis, a 2008 Category 4 storm that cut a devastating path across Myanmar, killing an estimated 140,000 people. Others came to the township for refuge after fleeing violent attacks on civilians in Rakhine state that forced tens of thousands of people to flee that region northwest of Yangon.

The pressure on civilians has increased in the chaos since the February 2021 military takeover from the democratically elected government.

According to the U.N., more than 1.2 million people have been forced to relocate within the country since the coup. The military junta’s removal of civilian homes is a violation of basic human rights, a war crime and a crime against humanity, two human rights experts said in a Dec. 2, 2022, statement released by the United Nations. 

Two Mingalardon township residents reportedly took their own lives after the military ordered them to vacate their homes, the statement said.

“Forced evictions and mass burning of homes are gross violations of human rights. The junta must immediately stop the systematic destruction, burning and bulldozing of civilian homes,” Balakrishnan Rajagopal, U.N. special rapporteur on housing, and Thomas Andrews, special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, said in the statement. 

Fragile economy

Compounding the problem for the displaced families like Ma Hla’s is that under pressure from sanctions, worker strikes and consumer boycotts, Myanmar’s economy is significantly smaller than it was before the coup.

Unable to afford new homes, some of the families have been forced to live in monasteries for shelter since their evictions. 

A retired headmistress, who bought a house in the Gon Nyin Ni ward with her pension money, told RFA in November that her home had been demolished just two months after her purchase. 

“I got a pension after working for the government for about 40 years. I bought a house there that was priced 6 or 7 million kyats, with the gratuity I got. I wanted to stay in my own house. I am really saddened now that this happened.”

Because the military has destroyed their homes, the residents will also likely need to be compensated to pay to rebuild them if they are allowed to return. 

Military response

The military junta has not publicly responded to the requests by the evicted Mingalardon residents. 

Under threat, the number of protesters has dwindled. Around 100 people gathered the first day on Feb. 5, but only around 40 were left on Feb. 7, local people 

said.

Ma Cho is one of the protesters who has since retreated out of fear. 

“I dare not go there to demand anymore,” she told RFA. “The government officials threaten us in many ways. In addition, they have hired some lawless fighters who are holding swords.

“Although I don’t have anything, I am still very scared.”

Others said they would continue to push for some sort of compensation, despite the risks. 

“We are facing difficulties now,” said evicted resident Ko Maung. “Our livelihood has been difficult. Since we don’t have stable jobs, we can’t even afford our food.

“We can’t pay the rent. I don’t think it’s going to get better this way,” he said. “That’s why, we are going to demand on behalf of all the residents, a chance to return to our wards no matter how poorly we will have to live there.”",Right to Protest

190,Myanmar,Myanmar: pro-democracy WHRDs beaten in detention,27/02/2023,"Guards injured more than 80 political prisoners at a prison in central Myanmar after an argument turned violent, an incident which observers say is typical in the prison system since the junta took control of the country in a coup more than two years ago.

The incident occurred on Feb. 4 at Mandalay’s Obo Prison while a group of inmates, all female, were in line to get hot water, and some of the women began arguing with the guards.

“That’s when the prison guards came in and beat them. It’s said that the guards who came in and beat included some male staff too,” a family member of one of the prisoners told Radio Free Asia’s Burmese Service on condition of anonymity for security reasons.

“And then the prisoners were punished with solitary confinement. … But I don’t know if [my family member]  was among the ones sent to solitary. This is all I know for now. Their news doesn't spread much these days,” the family member said.

Since the junta ousted Myanmar’s democratically elected government in Feb. 2021, it began filling the country’s prisons with pro-democracy activists who were opposed to the coup. Reports have surfaced that these political prisoners are routinely beaten, sent to solitary confinement, transferred to prisons far away from their families, tortured, or even killed in an effort to silence them and dissuade others from resisting junta rule.

In the Feb. 4 incident, the guards employed rubber and wooden batons and slingshots on the crowd. Collectively, the women suffered two lacerated ears, six skull injuries, a broken hand, an eye injury, three slingshot impacts near the eyes, and around 70 milder slingshot injuries, the shadow National Unity Government’s Ministry of Women, Youth and Children Affairs said in a statement on Feb. 15.

According to that statement, 42 of the injured inmates were sent to another prison building, two were sent to solitary confinement, and another 40 were sent to separated cells. Additionally, the prisoners may not receive visits from their families for one month.

RFA contacted Naing Win, the junta spokesman for the prison department, to find out about the situation at Obo Prison, but he did not respond.

Malice against activists

These types of human rights violations against political prisoners are typical of the junta because they hold malice against those who support democracy, Aung Myo Min, the shadow government’s human rights minister told RFA.

“Political prisoners are those who bravely stand for rights and democracy in the fight against the military junta. That’s why they were specifically targeted,” he said. “It’s not just the military officers who arrest them, but the prison officials and staff also hate them because they think that the political prisoners are an extra burden for them. As a result, [they] continue to get tortured and suffer unjust and brutal punishments.”

The Obo prison incident was one of several examples of prison violence in this year alone.

Two inmates were killed and 70 others were injured on Jan. 6 at Pathein Prison in the Ayeyarwady region on Jan. 6. 

In the second week of January, about 700 inmates at Yangon’s Insein Prison were suddenly transferred to other prisons. On Jan. 25, two Insein inmates were sent to solitary confinement for reporting problems to prison officials, their relatives and other sources close to them told RFA.

The oppression that inmates suffer is invisible to the public and the international community, an activist who started an inmate advocacy group called “Let’s Send Things to Prisoners,” told RFA. 

“I must say that these incidents should never happen whether inside or outside prisons. But since the prisoners are in [authorities’] hands, our words have no effect on them,” the activist said on condition of anonymity for security reasons. “It looks like [inmates] have to endure whatever pain [authorities] inflict on them. 

The activist called on the shadow government and other diplomatic officials to work together to make the rest of the world aware of the situation in Myanmar’s prisons.

“Many people are being unfairly tortured in prisons without the people knowing it,” the activist said.

The prison guards should worry that they could one day be found guilty of crimes against the inmates under their charge, Kyaw Win, the executive director of the U.K.-based Burma Human Rights Network, told RFA.

“I’d like to warn the prison authorities, officials, and staff that their personal records are out, and the people know who they are,” he said. “The military generals and officers will just save themselves in the end. They will not care about these low level staff. That’s why these people should see the dangers they are creating for themselves.”

The junta-administered Myanmar National Human Rights Commission released a report on Feb. 2 based on interviews with hundreds of prisoners nationwide, that stated allegations of human rights violations were being seriously investigated, but the report did not specifically mention that any violations were found.

An official of the Thailand-based Assistance Association for Political Prisoners said that the military intentionally commits human rights violations against its imprisoned political opponents.

“Those who allowed, ordered and personally committed such violations and torture will definitely receive punishment for their crimes one day,” the official said. “We hear incidents of such torture happening everywhere and I want to say that those who commit those cruelties will definitely pay for their crimes.”

The activist called on the shadow government and other diplomatic officials to work together to make the rest of the world aware of the situation in Myanmar’s prisons.

“Many people are being unfairly tortured in prisons without the people knowing it,” the activist said.

The prison guards should worry that they could one day be found guilty of crimes against the inmates under their charge, Kyaw Win, the executive director of the U.K.-based Burma Human Rights Network, told RFA.

“I’d like to warn the prison authorities, officials, and staff that their personal records are out, and the people know who they are,” he said. “The military generals and officers will just save themselves in the end. They will not care about these low level staff. That’s why these people should see the dangers they are creating for themselves.”

The junta-administered Myanmar National Human Rights Commission released a report on Feb. 2 based on interviews with hundreds of prisoners nationwide, that stated allegations of human rights violations were being seriously investigated, but the report did not specifically mention that any violations were found.

An official of the Thailand-based Assistance Association for Political Prisoners said that the military intentionally commits human rights violations against its imprisoned political opponents.

“Those who allowed, ordered and personally committed such violations and torture will definitely receive punishment for their crimes one day,” the official said. “We hear incidents of such torture happening everywhere and I want to say that those who commit those cruelties will definitely pay for their crimes.”

As of Tuesday the junta has arrested 19,810 people since the beginning of the coup, 15,953 of whom are currently detained, including those who have been sentenced, according to the group’s statistics.",Right to healthy and safe environment
191,Afghanistan,Afghanistan: academic beaten and arrested for criticising education ban on women,05/02/2023,"Afghan professor Ismail Mashal went viral on social media late last year after he ripped up his academic degrees live on TV to protest the Taliban's ban on women attending university.

More recently, the 37-year-old professor handed out hundreds of free books to girls and women across the capital, Kabul.

But on February 2, Mashal’s defiance of the Taliban’s restrictions on female education finally caught up with him. The professor was beaten and arrested by Taliban fighters.

Mashal is the latest victim of the Taliban’s crackdown on dissent. Since seizing power in 2021, the hard-line Islamists have violently dispersed peaceful protesters and detained and beaten journalists and activists.

Mashal is among the scores of Afghan university professors and teachers who resigned after the Taliban banned university education for women on December 20, in a move that triggered a local and international outcry.

192,Philippines,"Philippines: police dismantled community barricade, two injured",05/02/2023,"Two people were hurt after police dispersed a human barricade formed by residents of Sibuyan Island in Romblon in response to the sudden escalation of mining activities there, environmental groups reported Friday.

Videos posted by groups Alyansa Tigil Mina and Living Laudato Si’ showed local police dispersing community members protesting the operations of Altai Philippines Mining Corporation (APMC) on Sibuyan Island.

This allowed three trucks of APMC carrying nickel ore for export to pass through.

“[The police] forced to break up the people who blocked the trucks… We couldn't handle it because we were outnumbered,” Donato Royo, a barangay official who was present during the dispersal, said in Filipino.

Sibuyanons are opposing the extraction of nickel ore on the island, saying it will disrupt Sibuyan’s intact ecosystems, including Mt. Guiting Guiting Natural Park, and the livelihood of locals.

According to the residents, the mining company failed to secure permits at the local level.

“On these grounds, and in the context of years of resistance of Sibuyanons against mining on their island, the people’s barricade is just and legitimate,” Kalikasan People’s Network for the Environment said.

Environmentalist Rodne Galicha, a resident of Sibuyan Island, accused the mining firm of conniving with the Philippine National Police and local politicians.

“This act of protecting the mining company is unacceptable knowing that there are violations and deception from the very start they stepped foot on the island,” said Galicha, executive director of non-profit Living Laudato Si'.

Galicha also said choppers carrying military personnel will arrive in Sibuyan.

“The situation here is getting more extreme. We have never experienced something like this here… We are just asserting our right to a clean and sustainable environment,” he added.

Philstar.com sought the comment of the PNP, but it has yet to respond as of posting.

Galicha urged local governments in Romblon to issue a cease and desist against the mining firm, and the House of Representatives and the Senate to conduct a hearing in aid of legislation.

Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri said the upper chamber is “open to any environmental degradation claims that need to be investigated.”

“If there’s a resolution filed, we can do that,” Zubiri said on the sidelines of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources’ multi-stakeholder forum in Cagayan De Oro City on Friday.

DENR Secretary Toni Yulo-Loyzaga on Thursday said the agency “will take a good look” at the issue of mining on the island.

But Elizabeth Ibañez, coordinator of environmental group Sibuyanons Against Mining, said they want authorities to go beyond investigating the situation on their island.

""Sibuyanons are sick of promises. Our mountains are being destroyed, but they’re still conducting investigations,"" she said in Filipino.

194,Indonesia,Indonesia: three land rights defenders arrested,06/03/2023,"On Friday the 3rd of February 2023, Mr. Mulyadi, Mr. Suwarno and Mr. Untung were forcibly arrested by the police officers of the East Java Regional Police by blocking the car that they were travelling in and immediately leading them into a police car.

Illegal arrest 

According to the information that we received, the police officer who arrested them did not show an assignment letter and was unable to show arrest warrants, the reasons for the arrest and a brief description of the alleged crime and where they were going to be taken. The AHRC considers this action to be an act of deprivation of liberty that violates human rights as stipulated in Article 18 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (KUHAP).

Moreover, the AHRC also refers to Law, No. 26 of 2000 on the Human Rights Law under Article 34:

Paragraph 1: Every victim of and witness to a gross violation of human rights has the right to physical and mental protection from threats, harassment, terror, and violence by any party whosoever. 

Paragraph 2: Protection as referred to in Clause (1) is an obligatory duty of the law enforcement and security apparatus, provided free of charge.

Paragraph 3: Provisions on procedures for protecting witnesses shall be further governed in a Government Regulation.

Police Regulation (Perkap) Number 8 of 2009, Article 17 stated: 

Paragraph (1): In conducting an arrest, an officer must: a. inform/present his/her identity as an Indonesia National Police officer; b. present a warrant for arrest, except where the suspect was caught during the commission of a crime; c. inform the reason for the arrest; d. explain the charges and the possible punishment to the suspect upon arrest; e. respect the legal status of a minor perpetrating a crime and inform the parent or guardian immediately following the arrest; f. protect the privacy of the suspect in custody; and g. inform the suspect of his/her rights and how to exercise such rights, consisting of the right to remain silent, the right to receive legal support and/or to be accompanied by a legal counsel, and other rights as provided under the Penal Procedural Code. 

Paragraph (2): Following an arrest, an officer must prepare a report of the arrest which states: a. the name and identity of the officer making the arrest; b. the name and identity of the person under arrest; c. the location, date and time of the arrest; d. the reason for the arrest and/or the charges; e. the place of temporary detention during custody; and f. The health condition of the person under arrest.

Invalid suspect status

In addition, before being forcibly arrested, Mr. Mulyadi, Mr. Suwarno and Mr, Untung had already been named suspects by the East Java Regional Police for alleged fake news as stated under the Law, Number 1 of 1946 on the Handling of Hoax News. 

The three of them knew that they had been named suspects on January 20th, 2023 based on a summons as suspects. According to the information that we have received, prior to the determination of them as suspects, the three of them had never provided prior information as potential suspects or witnesses, and though the three of them had been summoned, the summons they had received was inappropriate because they had received the new summons after the examination schedule in the overdue letter. In addition, they never clearly knew about the accusations and evidence in the case against the three, and because of that, the Coalition considered that the determination of the trio as suspects by the East Java Regional Police violated Article 1 Point 14 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and also the Constitutional Court Decision No. 21/PUU/XII/2014 and is therefore invalid.

​​​​​​​Mulyadi, Suwarno and Untung are human rights defenders

The judgment of the three is clearly a practice of prosecuting human rights defenders, due to the fact that the accusations against them do not stand alone but because of their activities to defend and fight for their rights of agrarian resources which are in conflict with the Bumi Sari Company (PT. Bumi Sari) since a long time ago. This pattern of prosecution is common and affects human rights defenders, and for this reason, the Government should take steps to protect it as stated in Article 28C Paragraph (2) of the 1945 Constitution and Article 100 of the Law on Human Rights, and Article 1 of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders. 

Pretrial is in progress 

Before being forcibly arrested by the East Java Regional Police, on January 30th 2023, the three were submitted to a pretrial at the Banyuwangi District Court in relation to their determination as suspects which was allegedly carried out haphazardly and arbitrarily by the East Java Regional Police, at a time when the investigation against the three should have been suspended temporarily until the pretrial to be decided by the Judge who receives, examines and adjudicates the case.",Land rights

196,Pakistan,Pakistan: media worker arrested for alleged hate speech,05/02/2023,"Pakistan authorities must immediately and unconditionally release journalist Imran Riaz Khan and cease targeting journalists in retaliation for their commentary on the military, the Committee to Protect Journalists said Thursday.

In the early hours of Thursday, February 2, officers with Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency arrested Khan, an anchor with the privately owned broadcaster BOL News and host of a YouTube channel with about 3.8 million subscribers, according to news reports.

FIA officers arrested Khan at Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International Airport, where he was leaving for the United Arab Emirates, in response to an investigation into alleged hate speech, according to those sources.

The first information report in Khan’s case, a document opening an investigation, was shared on Twitter and shows that the FIA’s cybercrime wing is investigating Khan under the 2016 Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act and the penal code. CPJ has repeatedly documented how the PECA has been used to detain, investigate, and harass journalists in retaliation for their work.

“Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency must immediately release journalist Imran Riaz Khan and drop any investigation in retaliation for his work,” said Beh Lih Yi, CPJ’s Asia program coordinator. “Authorities must allow journalists to freely comment on state institutions, including the military. Arresting journalists for their commentary or reporting smacks of a desperate attempt to silence criticism.”

The first information report alleges that Khan engaged in “hate speech” aimed at creating a “rift between the general public and the state institutions” during his speech at a January 30 seminar on violence against journalists in Pakistan, clips of which were shared on social media. In that speech, Khan questioned Qamar Javed Bajwa, a former army general, who said in his final speech before his retirement in November 2022 that the army would remain apolitical in Pakistan.

Authorities accuse Khan of violating sections of the PECA pertaining to electronic forgery, malicious code, and committing an offense in relation to an information system, according to the first information report, which says he is also accused under the penal code of abetment of mutiny, defamation, and public mischief. Abetment of mutiny can carry a punishment of life imprisonment, according to the law.

On January 13, FIA officers arrested journalist Shahid Aslam, alleging he was involved in coverage of the assets of Bajwa and his family. He was released on bail on January 18, news reports said.

CPJ was unable to locate contact details for Bajwa. CPJ emailed the FIA for comment but did not receive any response.

In May 2022, the Islamabad High Court ordered the director of the FIA cybercrime wing to coordinate with the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists and other representative bodies prior to initiating punitive action against journalists, according to news reports. The union plans to file a petition in court challenging Khan’s arrest on Friday, BOL News reported.

Police previously detained Khan from July 5 to 9, 2022, after a slew of cases were registered against him, according to CPJ reporting and news reports. On July 14, 2022, authorities ordered Khan off a Dubai-bound flight from the Lahore airport, according to a tweet by the journalist and his lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq, who spoke with CPJ via messaging app at the time.

CPJ called Ashfaq and contacted him via messaging app for comment on Khan’s latest arrest but did not immediately receive any replies.",Right to liberty and security
197,Viet Nam,Vietnam: academic detained after 6-month investigation (Update),06/02/2023,"Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security has ordered the detention of the former director of the Southeast and North Asia Institute of Technology Research and Development following six months of house arrest.

According to a post on its website on Feb. 2, the ministry’s Security Investigation Agency arrested Nguyen Son Lo because he “showed signs of continuing to commit crimes.”

The ministry launched an investigation in July 2022, under the controversial Article 331 of Vietnam’s Penal Code for ""abusing freedom and democracy infringe upon the interests of the state, the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and individuals.""

Human rights groups in Vietnam and around the world say 331 is used to silence and arbitrarily detain political activists.

The ministry said it had “issued an arrest warrant for the accused for temporary detention and a search warrant for the defendant's residence and workplace,” without saying what crimes Lo allegedly continued to commit.

The ministry has never given specifics on why Lo was being investigated, saying last July the Investigation Security Agency was “focusing on investigating, collecting documents, and consolidating evidence on the criminal acts of the accused and related individuals … according to the provisions of law.""

Lo founded the think-tank, known as SENA, and wrote many books intended to offer advice to Vietnam’s leaders, with recommendations on politics, economy and culture.

Lo’s close friend Nguyen Khac Mai, director of the Hanoi-based Minh Triet Cultural Research Center, told RFA last year the Communist Party advised him not to send his books to provincial party secretaries or National Assembly deputies but send them internally to groups such as the Secretariat and the Politburo of the party’s Central Committee.

199,Afghanistan,Afghanistan: academic and women's rights advocate arrested,25/04/2023,"The UN mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) on Monday welcomed the reported release of two women’s rights activists Nargis Sadat and Zakaria Osuli.

However, the mission said it remained concerned about ongoing arbitrary detention of a number of Afghanistan civil society activists, including rights defenders who had spoken out about rights of women and girls, some held incommunicado for months.

Sadat, member of the Leadership Council of the Movement, was detained on February 23 from Pul-i-Sokhta area of Kabul.

“We continue to engage with de facto authorities on cases but are dismayed by lack of information provided, despite ongoing requests, “ UNAMA said, calling for the immediate release of all those arbitrarily detained.

“No Afghan should be detained for exercising their freedom of expression”.

Before UNAMA tweet, Nargis Sadat’s husband confirmed to Voice of America that his wife had been released, but did not provide further details.

According to Voice of America, officials told her husband that his wife was against the regime and had anti-Taliban videos and pictures on her phone.

The caretaker government is yet to comment about the release of the two activists.

Sources confirmed that women’s rights activist Nargis Sadat was released after nearly two months in Taliban prison on Monday afternoon.

Two sources from her relatives and friends said Sadat returned home at around 1 pm Kabul time on Monday.

Taliban so far has not commented on her release.

Meanwhile, Zakaria Osuli, a university lecturer and writer, was released from Taliban prison, his family confirmed. His family said he returned home nearly at around 12 pm local time on Monday. Taliban has not commented on his release. Osuli was arrested in Khairkhana area in the north of Kabul on Feb. 2.

This comes as the women’s protest movement on Sunday, April 9, said that women’s rights activist Nargis Sadat who was arrested by the Taliban in February “has been severely tortured” while in custody and is “ill.”

The movement said in a statement that Sadat’s feet and hands have turned “black” and are swollen and covered in blisters. The movement also said she was in a critical psychological condition.

The movement added that over the past two weeks, Sadat has been kept with two other women in one cell. These two women have been charged with having links with Daesh.

According to the movement, Sadat is a leading member of the women’s protest movement and was arrested in Kabul on Feb. 11. She had been ill at the time and was on her way to a hospital when detained.

Reports indicate that at least five people, including a journalist, a musician, two activists and a university lecturer, are in Taliban custody for the past few weeks.

200,China,China: Tibetan family threatened for protesting their relative imprisonment,12/02/2023,"Family members of the renowned Tibetan businessman Dorjee Tashi have been cautioned by police against protesting his innocence after calling for his release last week. They are nevertheless awaiting a response from the local court.

Last week, family members including Dorjee Tashi’s elder sister, Gonpo Kyi, staged protests outside Tibet Higher People’s Court in Lhasa. They held a written banner stating: ‘the charge and judgement of Tibet’s Higher People’s Court of Tibetan Autonomous Region against Dorjee Tashi is false and unfair.’

A source told Tibet Watch that, after one protest, security personnel outside the court took Gonpo Kyi away to a police station somewhere in Lhasa. When her brother Dorjee Tsetan later came to take her home, police threatened to arrest the pair if they continued to protest. Undeterred by this, they carried out another demonstration the following day.

On Saturday, Tibet Watch received an update that Dorjee Tseten and Gonpo Kyi had agreed to temporarily cease their protests after court authorities promised to respond in a week.

The source added that the pair are “determined to protest if authorities failed to resolve or delay the case.”

Gonpo Kyi had previously staged a sit-in protest about her brother’s continued detention in front of the same court last June. Dorjee Tseten wrote an open letter arguing that his younger brother had been framed by powerful leaders.  

Dorjee Tashi was detained on 10 July 2008 and subsequently charged with loan fraud. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and has already spent more than 14 years in prison, despite the Beijing-based Zheng Xin Law Firm stating that Dorjee Tashi’s loan fraud conviction was false. His lawyers claim that he had in fact committed the lesser crime of capital misappropriation in the Qin Sangyuan company, where he was the biggest investor.

A source told Tibet Watch that, after one protest, security personnel outside the court took Gonpo Kyi away to a police station somewhere in Lhasa. When her brother Dorjee Tsetan later came to take her home, police threatened to arrest the pair if they continued to protest. Undeterred by this, they carried out another demonstration the following day.

On Saturday, Tibet Watch received an update that Dorjee Tseten and Gonpo Kyi had agreed to temporarily cease their protests after court authorities promised to respond in a week.

The source added that the pair are “determined to protest if authorities failed to resolve or delay the case.”

Gonpo Kyi had previously staged a sit-in protest about her brother’s continued detention in front of the same court last June. Dorjee Tseten wrote an open letter arguing that his younger brother had been framed by powerful leaders.  

Dorjee Tashi was detained on 10 July 2008 and subsequently charged with loan fraud. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and has already spent more than 14 years in prison, despite the Beijing-based Zheng Xin Law Firm stating that Dorjee Tashi’s loan fraud conviction was false. His lawyers claim that he had in fact committed the lesser crime of capital misappropriation in the Qin Sangyuan company, where he was the biggest investor.

According to the source, the last virtual meeting that Dorjee Tashi’s family was able to have with him was in December 2021. No physical visit or meeting has been permitted since 2019.",Right to Protest
201,Kyrgyzstan,Kyrgyzstan: independent media outlet compelled to self-censorship,05/02/2023,"In response to news reports that Kyrgyzstan authorities ordered the independent news outlet Kloop to take down a recent article or have its website blocked for two months, the Committee to Protect Journalists issued the following statement of condemnation:

“Kyrgyzstan authorities’ attempt to censor Kloop, one of the country’s most respected news outlets, once again shows the absurdity and arbitrariness of its false information law, which should never have been enacted,” said Gulnoza Said, CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia program coordinator, in New York. “Authorities should withdraw their threat to block Kloop’s website, repeal the false information law, and cease their escalating repression of the independent press.”

On January 20, Kloop covered allegations that the state Community Development and Investment Agency, known as ARIS, had inflated its construction costs. On January 25, the outlet reported that ARIS denied the allegations.

In a letter sent along with other documents dated Wednesday, February 1, the Ministry of Culture, Information, Sport, and Youth Policy demanded that Kloop “immediately” remove or amend the January 25 article. ARIS objected to the summary of its denial, that article’s headline, and the mention of a government official who accused the agency of inflating its costs, according to reports by Kloop.

Kloop has refused to take down the article, saying it did not contain false information. If the outlet refuses to comply, its website could be blocked for at least two months under the country’s false information law.

202,Cambodia,"Cambodia: labour union march halted, threatened with legal action",05/02/2023,"A small march vaguely calling for “morality” in the country’s politics faced obstacles within the first day of its planned 10-day trek from Phnom Penh to Pursat as authorities blocked them from sleeping at a pagoda.

Around 50 people gathered near Phnom Penh’s Wat Phnom on Wednesday to begin the nationalist march, as participants waved Cambodian and Buddhist flags.

The march was organized by the Cambodian Independent Teachers’ Association, an opposition-aligned body formerly led by union leader Rong Chhun, who recently joined the Candlelight Party.

The association’s current director, Ouk Chhayavy, said at the start of the march that ethics among both the rich and poor were declining in Cambodia, and the country was headed toward “ethical disaster.”

But all the examples and demands of such immorality she and the protesters raised were political.

“We do this pilgrimage because we have seen society facing a huge immorality crisis, including the top person — the prime minister has also used abusive language,” Chhayavy said. “We want to see all ranks of people unite and use good and sweet language to each other.”

Unionist Chhun, known for racially tinged anti-Vietnamese comments, called for the release of political prisoners.

“We have to end this kind of culture of considering all Khmer as enemies. We must unite to lift up this poor country and make it as glorious as other countries,” Chhun said.

He said on Thursday that the group was unable to sleep at a pagoda in Kandal’s Ponhea Leu overnight as the pagoda chief asked them to get permission from the commune chief, who told them to ask the district governor, who refused. They stayed in villagers’ homes instead, he said.

In the afternoon, he said the group was now in Kampong Chhnang and could again face difficulties finding a place to sleep.

The group has issued four demands: political reconciliation, end of political harassment, release of political prisoners, and for Cambodians to stop taking sides in politics.

Cambodian Institute for Democracy president Pa Chanroeun said the public might be sympathetic to the march as many people in the country remained Buddhist.

Interior Ministry spokesman Khieu Sopheak, however, said last month that in his opinion, he didn’t think the pilgrimage would bring any good to society, and questioned how the association was assessing a decline in ethics.

“If they based this pilgrimage like they said in the letter on society’s ethics declining, what measurement did they use? What did they base it on? What kind of scale did they use? Generally when we say something, we need to speak reasonably. Going down?” Sopheak said. “This is just my own opinion, but I don’t think it benefits anything.”

The warning came after the prominent teachers’ union announced it would be holding a 10-day march from Phnom Penh to Kandal, Kampong Speu, Kampong Chhnang, and Pursat provinces starting February 10 to raise attention to issues of injustice.

In response, the ministry said only 50 participants would be permitted to join and also said that a December demonstration at Phnom Penh’s Freedom Park calling for the release of political prisoners violated an order by the Phnom Penh municipality banning their marches. 

The same letter said that the association would need to send documentation outlining its bank accounts and financial activities over the past year. 

“In case the association does not implement the spirit of the letter above, the Ministry of Interior will take legal measures according to the law,” it continued.

Yearly financial reports are required under the Law on Association and Non-governmental Organization (LANGO), a controversial law passed in 2015 that rights groups and many legal experts say is aimed at stifling NGO activity. 

Uk Chhayavy, president of CITA, told CamboJA that the ministry’s letter is intended to threaten the group in response to its efforts to raise awareness of rights abuses by the government. 

“This is an image to threaten us for being scary, but for me, I am not afraid because what I have done follows the law,” she said.

“We will submit [our records] to the Interior Ministry, but our association does not have funds, and has no money in its bank account,” Chhayavy said.

However, she said that her association is preparing its report and will be submitting to the ministry by its deadline. Chhayavy added that donors had stopped providing funds to the association about six years ago, and the association now survives from membership fees and personal volunteers.

She also defended the previous demonstration, noting that it followed the Law on Peaceful Assembly, which requires only that authorities be informed of a planned demonstration.

Ny Sokha, president of rights group Adhoc, said that while the Interior Ministry’s request for financial reports followed the law, the larger aim of such laws was to pressure NGOs.

“Generally, the nature of LANGO is to put restrictions on the rights and freedom,” he said.  

Vorn Pao, president of Independent Democratic of Informal Economic Association, said that the letter appeared intended to serve as pressure to scare away the public from joining the planned February march. 

“I think that the state [Interior Ministry] should not issue the letter asking for a financial report, while they have already allowed the association to hold the gathering,” he said.

“It has added more pressure on the association and emotional pressure on them and a strategy to show the public not to join that event,” Pao said. 

 The planned February 10 march will see teachers, students, and others gathering at Wat Phnom before setting off on National Road 5. The final destination is in Pursat province, at a statue of Khleang Moeung — a sixteenth century military leader who has gained mythical status as a guardian spirit. 

Interior Ministry spokesperson, Khieu Sopheak, said that the letter contained no threats, and only outlined the legal situation. 

“It is their business whatever they want to say, and how can we threaten, it is just a small association,” he said.

“We have not seen their reports, that is the reason we tell them to submit it,” Sopheak said. “We want to know what bank account they have been using right now,” he said.

Sopheak added that the ministry has allowed only 50 participants to march and they need to cooperate with authorities and police in each province.

“We have allowed only 50 participants in the meeting. Note that if there are more, [we] we will take action,” he said.",Freedom of assembly

The city-run company filed the suit with the Seoul Central District Court on Friday seeking damages of 601.45 million won ($484,000) for train delays and other losses caused by 75 illegal protests staged by the Solidarity Against Disability Discrimination (SADD) since Dec. 3, 2021, they said.

The group staged subway-riding protests at major stations in central Seoul, demanding an increased government budget to protect the rights of people with disabilities.

Wheelchair-bound activists have repeatedly boarded and disembarked trains disrupting metro services during the morning rush hour.

Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon late last month declared a zero-tolerance policy against their protests, warning of stern legal actions.

In late 2021, Seoul Metro filed a lawsuit against SADD, claiming 30 million won in compensation.

Last month, the Seoul Central District Court issued a mediation, calling for Seoul Metro to install more elevators at subway stations and SADD to stop protests. The court ruled SADD must pay Seoul Metro 5 million won for every five-minute delay in subway operations in the future.

The group accepted the compromise, but Seoul Metro and the city government rejected it.

SADD resumed the protests last month, and the company early last week warned of an additional lawsuit.

Last Wednesday, the group said it will suspend protests until Jan. 19 and demanded a meeting with Mayor Oh.

204,Philippines,Philippines: at least four EHRDs arrested on trumped up charges,05/02/2023,"A staff of the Cordillera Peoples Alliance (CPA) was arrested by the police today, January 30.

According to Baguio-based media outfit Northern Dispatch, Jennifer Awingan of CPA Research Commission was arrested for rebellion.

A warrant of arrest was issued January 24 by Regional Trial Court Branch 2 Presiding Judge Corpus B. Alzate for Awingan and eight others namely: CPA Chairperson Windel Bolinget, CPA Regional Council member Steve Tauli, development worker Sarah Abellon, Lourdes Jimenez of peasant group Apit-Tako, Florence Kang, acting executive director of Ilocos Center for Research Empowerment and Development, Northern Dispatch correspondent Niño Oconer, Jovencio Tangbawan, Salcedo Dumayom Dappay Jr. and Lucia Lourdes Gimenes.

Rebellion is a non-bailable offense.

Awingan is the mother of Kara Taggaoa, Kilusang Mayo Uno’s international officer, who was also arrested last year over trumped-p charges. In a Twitter post, Taggaoa said her mother was arrested in their house in Baguio City at 11:45 a.m. today.

“Ang nanay ko ay isang aktibista, hindi kriminal, hindi terorista. Palayain!” Taggaoa posted on Twitter. (My mother is an activist, not a criminal, not a terrorist. Release her!)

Progressive groups condemned the issuance of warrant of arrests without going through due process.

Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) said the respondents in the said case are not aware of the charges against them.

“We condemn the continuing weaponization of the law that is used to arrest and detain activists without bail. No due process was observed in this case as the respondents say that they were not duly informed of the case,” the group said in a statement.

Bayan reiterated that prosecutors and judges should not allow themselves to be used in filing trumped-up charges and rights violations.

“This must stop,” they added.

Awingan is active in campaigns against large-scale mining and dam projects in the region.

Environmental group Kalikasan People’s Network for the Environment meanwhile said that the warrant of arrests against their colleagues only shows that Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is following in the footsteps of his own father, the dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr., and of his predecessor, former President Rodrigo Duterte, “whose administrations weaponized the courts and the law to crush legal and legitimate community dissent.”

“We denounce this new attack on our colleagues from the Cordillera People’s Alliance, who do the work of environmental defense in that region rich with mineral and timber resources and rivers, all of which are being eyed by corporate plunderers,” the group said.

Meanwhile, Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU) demanded Alzate to “explain and be held accountable for the malicious use of his power, and being instrumental in the dirty campaign of the military and police and NTF-ELCAC against activists!”

It would be remembered that under the Duterte administration, several activists were arrested and scores were killed after local courts issued search warrants. One judge who has been known for issuing what activists called as “copy-paste warrants” is Quezon City Executive Judge Cecilyn Burgos-Villavert.

In 2021, amid the calls of lawyers and rights groups, the Supreme Court issued Administrative Matter No. 21-06-08-SC, which requires the use of at least one body-worn camera and one alternative recording device that can record the circumstances surrounding the execution of warrants.

The SC also removed the power provided to executive judges of Quezon City and Manila regional trial courts to issue search warrants that may be served anywhere in the country.

205,Cambodia,Cambodia: labour rights defenders questioned,05/02/2023,"Three hundred Tuol Sangke market vendors gathered outside the Interior Ministry this week to support three fellow vendors who were being questioned for alleged incitement for protesting new market rental rates.

The market vendors from Phsar Samhan market in Russei Keo district’s Tuol Sangke commune said they gathered outside the ministry on Monday to monitor the questioning of three other vendors who were being accused of incitement for participating in a protest against the doubling of market fees.

Voth Ravy, one of the 300 vendors, said the new market owner, Kim Chhay, wanted the vendors to pay $3,000 for a two-year contract to sell at the market, more than doubling the $1,500 the old owners charged for a three-year contract.

The vendors decided to protest against the move, which is when Chhay accused the three of incitement.

“We had never protested against anything before this new owner came in; we protested because he oppressed us too hard,” he said. 

“Just think about it — Covid has just ended! And the business is not going well at all. How can we have enough to pay $2,000 to $3,000 for one shop?”

Srun Phy, one of the three people summoned, said he never incited other vendors and did not try to harm the new owners. Protests broke out only because the new owner was being hard on them, Phy said.

“About this incitement thing, I refuse it all because what we did was unite. We did it together. I did not call or ask them to join me,” Phy said.

Interior Ministry spokesperson Khieu Sopheak said only that people had left the ministry after the questioning and that the ministry was still assessing the complaint. 

VOD could not reach Chhay, the new market owner.

207,Bangladesh,"Bangladesh: environmental lawyer intimidated, attacked",05/02/2023,"On 26 January 2023, woman environmental human rights defender Syeda Rizwana Hasan and
her team were attacked when their vehicles were pelted with stones. The events took place on
their visit to the Lake City residential area of Chattogram, a site where the hills have been razed for
a housing project, impacting the local environment.
Syeda Rizwana Hasan is a lawyer of the Bangladesh Supreme Court and the chief executive of
Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA). She is a member of the Environmental
Law Alliance Worldwide, and the Environmental Law Commission of International Unions for the
Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Additionally, she is a member of the board of the South Asian
Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE). Over the past 20 years,
Syeda Rizwana Hasan has been advocating for environment protection on issues such as
deforestation, pollution, unregulated ship breaking, illegal appropriation of wetlands, cutting of hills,
unregulated mining, unplanned urbanization, commercial shrimp cultivation, and illegal land
development in Bangladesh. In 2022, she was awarded the International Women of Courage
Award by the US Department of State.
On 26 January 2023 at around 12.30pm, members of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyer’s
Association (BELA), along with several journalists, visited the aforementioned housing project in
the Lake City residential area. Following this, they visited Kalirichara Khal, a body of water which
has been filled in as part of the construction. This development has been headed by Jahirul Alam
Jashim. Jashim is a local leader of the national ruling party, as well as a local Councillor of
Chottogram City Corporation. While the woman environmental human rights defender was
conducting this visit, a group of people started to follow the team and made attempts to intimidate
them by questioning them about their reasons for being there. As Syeda Rizwana Hasan and her
team proceeded towards the site, Jahurul Alam Jashim and his men appeared, brandishing sharp
weapons, and obstructed them from entering the site. The woman environmental human rights
defender escaped to the nearby bypass road and called the police to come to the scene. By the
time they arrived, she had reached her car. However, when she subsequently made an attempt to
leave the vicinity, Jahirul Alam Jashim and his men pelted the car with stones, also aiming for
Sayeda Rizwana Hasan herself.
The woman human rights defender has filed a complaint against Jahurul Alam Jashim, along with
other individuals, at the Akbar Shah police station. However, as of yet, no action has been taken
against the main accused, Jahurul Alam Jashim.
This is not the first time that the woman human rights defender has been targeted for her human
rights work. Those close to her have also been the subject of harassment as a result of her
activism. Her husband, Abu Bakar Siddique, was abducted by unidentified men on 16 April 2014.

208,Kazakhstan,Kazakhstan: opposition leader targeted with fresh charges (Update),05/02/2023,"As Kazakhstan gears up for parliamentary elections this spring, the Almaty City Prosecutor’s office on January 26 charged the opposition leader of the unregistered Democratic Party of Kazakhstan, Zhanbolat Mamay, with “organizing mass riots,” for his alleged role in the January 2022 protests in Almaty. The charge carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence.

Oddly, this “new” charge comes just two months after the prosecutor’s office dropped an identical charge, reclassifying his alleged actions as “violating the procedure for organizing and holding peaceful assemblies.” Mamay was placed under house arrest after spending just over eight months in pretrial detention. Mamay also faces lesser charges of “insulting law enforcement officers” and “disseminating false information.” His trial on those began November 7, 2022 and is set to resume on February 6. Mamay remains under house arrest. Kazakhstan does not allow any genuinely independent opposition parties; Mamay’s party has not been able to register.

The new 59-page indictment asserts that Mamay decided to “organize mass riots, accompanied by violence, pogroms, arson, destruction, property damage, the use of firearms, as well as armed resistance to the authorities.” At least 238 people died in the January 2022 events in Kazakhstan, most of them in Almaty. The authorities have failed to ensure accountability for the hundreds who died or who alleged ill-treatment and torture following the violence.

What is lacking in the indictment is any evidence that Mamay committed the alleged crime.

The prosecutor argues that in order to organize mass riots, Mamay uploaded videos to Facebook calling on Almaty residents to join the peaceful protest on January 4, that he misinformed the crowd by saying tens of thousands of people had gathered in the city of Zhanaozen, and that he acted on people’s heightened emotions to call for a fair government, a fair election, political reform, the dissolution of Parliament, and registration of political parties in Kazakhstan.

Expert analyses commissioned by the prosecution concluded that Mamay “promoted destructive attitudes of civil and political behavior” and “contributed to the growth of protest activism on January 3-4, 2022.”

However, the indictment does not say Mamay carried out any violent acts or called for violence because there is no evidence he did.

Calling for political reforms is not a crime, but locking Mamay away for 10 years most certainly would be.",Right to political participation

209,Thailand,Thailand: pro-democracy defender sentenced to 28-year imprisonment (Update),05/02/2023,"A 29-year-old activist in Chiang Rai has been sentenced to 28 years in prison on royal defamation charges resulting from a number of Facebook posts about the monarchy. The Chiang Rai Provincial Court found him guilty on 14 counts.

Mongkhon Thirakot, a 29-year-old activist and online clothing vendor from Chiang Rai, was initially arrested in April 2021 while taking part in a hunger strike in front of the Ratchadaphisek Criminal Court to demand the release of activists held in pre-trial detention at the time.

He was later charged with royal defamation and violation of the Computer Crime Act for 25 Facebook posts he made between 2 – 11 March 2021, including messages referring to the King’s images, sharing video clips and foreign news reports about the Thai monarchy, and sharing posts from Somsak Jeamteerasakul’s Facebook page while adding captions.

Police officers also searched his house in Chiang Rai and confiscated several pieces of paper with messages written on them, a declaration by the activist group Ratsadorn, an armband with the three-finger salute symbol, and a red ribbon, and had his mother sign documents to acknowledge the search and confiscation. Mongkhon’s mobile phone was also confiscated when he was arrested in Bangkok.

He was arrested again in May 2021 and charged with 2 more counts on the same charges for 2 more Facebook posts. He was granted bail both times.

Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR) reported that the Chiang Rai Provincial Court yesterday (26 January) found Mongkhon guilty of 14 counts of royal defamation, on the ground that 14 out of the 27 posts can be determined to be about King Vajiralongkorn and that they are an expression of opinion that is outside the limit of the law. As for the remaining 13 posts, the Court said that they were either about the late King Bhumibol or an undetermined person and dismissed them.

The court sentenced Mongkhon to 3 years in prison on each count, but reduced the sentence to 2 years per count because he gave useful testimony, giving a total sentence of 28 years, which TLHR said is the highest sentence given for royal defamation since 2020. However, TLHR noted that his sentence is still lower than the sentence given to Anchan Preelert, who was initially arrested in 2015 and later sentenced to 43 years and 6 months in prison, the longest-ever sentence under the royal defamation law, for allegedly sharing and uploading clips on social media of an online talk show alleged to include defamatory comments about the monarchy. She has been detained since 20 January 2021 after the Appeal Court rejected her bail request.

Mongkhon’s sentence has been widely reported on international media, including NPR, Deutsche Welle, and several other Australian media outlets, such as the Canberra Times and the South Western Times.

Mongkhon was later granted bail to appeal his charges on the condition that he must not do anything that damages the monarchy or leave the country. Since he posted bail using a total of 300,000 baht in security when he was arrested, the court did not require additional security.

TLHR noted that the court ordered Mongkhon to be tried in secret, and that initially no one not involved in the trial was allowed inside the courtroom. Mongkhon’s lawyer had to ask the court for permission before Mongkhon’s parents could enter the courtroom.",Freedom of assembly

Between 2.10 pm and 2.20 pm, he received a series of phone calls from an unknown number. Each time, the person on the line asked him to urgently come to his seat in the court as they need some advice. Mr. Kabir said that he was drinking tea and would reach his seat shortly.
When Mr. Kabir reached his seat, he saw there were around four or five persons, including a woman named Ms. Manju Devi, standing there. As soon as he greeted them, one person
asked him to confirm his identity. Following this, Ms. Devi hit him first, and others joined in the assault and even tried to hit him on his private parts, and threatened to kill him.

A lawyer friend rushed to Mr. Kabir’s help and ushered him to the Sub-Divisional Office Court. At this stage, the HRD did not know who his assailants were and had never met them prior to this incident.
The HRD was very shaken for nearly 30 minutes. He had nearly lost his hearing during the time and was very disoriented. He then went to the local community health centre, which was situated next to the court premises, and was accompanied by other advocate friends
practicing at the court. At the clinic, the doctor recommended that he consults an ENT specialist.
Mr. Kabir and his friends then went to the Udaipurvati police station. There he filed a complaint, which was registered as an FIR (0033) at 6.26 pm. The police charged Mr. Vikas Kalawat and Ms. Manju Devi under sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 341 (wrongful restraint), 323 (voluntary hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.
On January 25, 2023, Mr. Kabir visited the BDK Hospital at Jhunjhunu for a medical test,
which showed that his left eardrum was ruptured due to the attack. He is undergoing treatment for the same.
The attack on the HRD was pre-meditated and those who have attacked him should be charged under section 307 (attempt to murder). The assailants also issued death threats. Mr. Kalawat is a politically influential person in the region and carries considerable clout.
Many of the HRD’s well-wishers have asked him to remain cautious and have advised him to take the public bus to work instead of his personal motorbike.
It is important to note that on January 24, 2023, a cross FIR (0035) was registered against
the HRD based on the complaint by Manju Devi, one of the assailants and accused in FIR 0033. The HRD has been charged under sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 323 (voluntary hurt), section 509 (word, gesture, or act intended to insult the modesty of women), and
section 384 (extortion) — which is a non-bailable offence.",Right to healthy and safe environment

Mr. Hansraj Kabir has been an advocate since 2012. He has been involved in human rights related work since 2002. He has been working for the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Rajasthan. Since September 2021, he has been visiting villages on
every Sunday to raise rights-based awareness and political and constitutional awareness
among SC & ST communities.
Background of the Incident:
Mr. Vikas Kalawat is a local political functionary who works for Mr. Rajendra Singh Gudha, a member of Rajasthan’s Legislative Assembly and a minister in the Rajasthan government. In March 2022, Mr. Kalawat duped two Dalit sisters of their rightful ownership of a piece of land and had transferred the land to his name. The two sisters filed an FIR in this case in their local police station and Mr. Kalawat was charged under Sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). However, the police closed the case in a couple of months.
The sisters approached Mr. Kabir to challenge the closure of the case in court. In September 2022, Mr. Kabir filed a petition with the Judicial Magistrate, Udaipurvati, challenging the police decision. The next hearing of the case was scheduled for February 17, 2023

213,India,"India: media workers intimidated, charged",18/03/2023,"About the Human Rights Defenders:
Mr. Akhilesh Sahu and Mr. Vijaylal Markam are journalists from Balrampur district in Chhattisgarh. Mr. Sahu works with the news portal Chhattisgarh Express News,and
Mr. Markam freelances for portals like TP News and Khabar Bharat. Both journalists have extensively covered issues like corruption, pilferage and injustice in rural areas, and have faced reprisals in the past. Mr. Markam was arrested and jailed for eight months under fabricated charges before he was granted bail by the High Court in
December 2022.

Details of the Incident:
On January 23, 2023, journalists Mr. Akhilesh Sahu and Mr. Vijaylal Markam visited the Shankarpur Primary School in Balrampur district on a reporting assignment.They published a video report the same day which showed that students were sitting on the ground in front of the school building for their lessons, and the school building and toilets were locked.

In the report, the head teacher of the school Mrs. Sunita and another teacher Mr. Vijay failed to provide any answers regarding when the facilities would be available.

On January 24, 2023, at 5:30 PM, an FIR (20/2023) was registered against journalists Mr. Akhilesh Sahu and Mr. Vijaylal Markam at the Raghunath Nagar Police Station, under Sections 294 (obscene acts or words in public), 34 (common intention), 384 (extortion), 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.

The complainant in the case was Ms. Sunita Singh, the head teacher of Shankarpur primary school. She alleged that on January 23, when the journalists visited the school for the reporting assignment, they drove their car recklessly, parked in front of the school gate, abused and threatened her and demanded a ransom.

Following the publication of the news report on January 23, 2023, the husband of Ms. Sunita Singh and Tendu Patta Prabandhak (government official who oversees the procurement of tendu leaves) of Raghunath Nagar Mr. Fulsay Ayam called Mr. Sahu and abused the journalists for undertaking the reporting assignment. He also threatened to capture and assault the journalists on a busy road, in full public view.

Subsequently, the journalists Mr. Sahu and Markam released the audio recording of this phone  onversation on social media, which brought much disrepute to tendu patta prabandhak Mr. Fulsay Ayam and head teacher Ms. Sunita Singh.",Right to healthy and safe environment
214,Kyrgyzstan,Kyrgyzstan: media outlet facing closure (Update),26/01/2023,"Reacting to news that the authorities in Kyrgyzstan have applied to a court to close Radio Azattyk, the national service of the US broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, said:

“The closure of Radio Azattyk would be a deep and stark attack on the right to freedom of expression in Kyrgyzstan adding to the continuing repression against journalists and other voices critical of the authorities. The international community cannot ignore the threat looming over human rights in Kyrgyzstan and must call on Bishkek to comply with its international human rights obligations in full. The application to close Radio Azattyk should be withdrawn, its website unblocked, and journalists and other media workers in Kyrgyzstan should be able to work without fear of reprisals.”

Background

On 24 January, Radio Azattyk was notified of an application submitted to the Lenin District Court in Bishkek by the Kyrgyzstan Ministry of Culture, Information, Sport and Youth, seeking to terminate Radio Azattyk’s operations. The reason for the lawsuit was reportedly the publication on Radio Azattyk’s social media channels of a video produced by the radio’s sister organization, Current Time TV, which covered the September 2022 border conflict between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The video allegedly violates the law “On the Mass Media,” which forbids “propaganda of war, violence and cruelty, national, religious exclusivity and intolerance to other peoples and nations.”

In October 2022, the material was cited as the reason for blocking Radio Azattyk’s website while its bank accounts were frozen under national money laundering laws. In December, the website ban was declared “indefinite.”

Over the past year, government critics, journalists and other media workers have been repeatedly harassed in Kyrgyzstan. On 23 November, Bolot Temirov, the founder of the investigative project Temirov Live, was stripped of his Kyrgyz citizenship and forcibly deported to Moscow in retaliation for his criticism of the authorities.",Right to work

215,Bangladesh,"Bangladesh: media worker arrested on false charges, tortured",27/01/2023,"Bangladesh authorities must immediately and unconditionally release journalist Raghunath Kha and investigate allegations that he was electrocuted and beaten in police custody, the Committee to Protect Journalists said Wednesday.

At around 11 a.m. on Monday, January 23, plainclothes police officers detained Kha, a correspondent for the privately owned broadcaster Deepto TV and privately owned newspaper Dainik Projonmo Ekattor, according to multiple news reports and a person familiar with the case who spoke to CPJ on the condition of anonymity, citing safety concerns. Kha was detained after reporting on a land dispute in the Khalishakhali area of the southwestern Satkhira district.

Police arrested Kha and two others, alleging they were involved in an attempted bomb blast in coordination with landless people in the area, and authorities initially denied that Kha was in custody, according to those sources.

When the journalist appeared in court the following day, he was unable to stand properly and said that police severely beat him, electrocuted him, and threatened to kill him if he continued reporting on landless people, the anonymous source told CPJ.

During that hearing, the court ordered Kha to be held in the Satkhira jail while his case is investigated. Police have not provided copies of the first information reports in Kha’s case, which would show the specific allegations against him, according to that source.

“Bangladeshi authorities’ arrest and alleged maltreatment of journalist Raghunath Kha constitute only the latest attack on press freedom in the country, where law enforcement continues to retaliate against journalists with raging impunity,” said Beh Lih Yi, CPJ’s Asia program coordinator. “Authorities must immediately and unconditionally release Kha, drop all cases against him, and conduct a swift investigation into claims that police physically abused him.”

Authorities did not produce Kha in court until about 5 p.m. on Tuesday, that source said, in apparent violation of Bangladesh’s code of criminal procedure, which provides that police must present an arrested person before a magistrate within 24 hours.

That source told CPJ that they believe authorities targeted the journalist in retaliation for his reporting highlighting the struggles of landless people in their conflict with land grabbers allegedly supported by police.

In recent months, Satkhira Police Superintendent Kazi Moniruzzaman repeatedly threatened Kha with arrest and legal retaliation in retaliation for his reporting, that source said, adding that the journalist submitted a written complaint sometime about those threats to Moinul Haque, the deputy inspector-general of the Khulna division police, which oversees the Satkhira branch of the force.

No action was taken against Moniruzzaman, that source told CPJ. CPJ emailed Moniruzzaman and Haque and sent them requests for comment via messaging app, but did not receive any replies.

CPJ has previously documented similar allegations of alleged police abuse of detained journalists in Bangladesh. Journalist Shahidul Alam, who was awarded CPJ’s International Press Freedom Award in 2020, told CPJ that police officers beat him in custody.

216,Indonesia,Indonesia: prominent Papuan media worker target of intimidation,27/01/2023,"A veteran journalist known for covering rights abuses in Indonesia’s militarised Papua region says a bomb exploded outside his home yesterday and a journalists group has called it an act of “intimidation” threatening press freedom.

No one was injured in the blast near his home in the provincial capital Jayapura, said Victor Mambor, editor of Papua’s leading news website Jubi, who visited New Zealand in 2014.

Police said they were investigating the explosion and that no one had yet claimed responsibility.

“Yes, someone threw a bomb,” Papua Police spokesperson Ignatius Benny told Benar News. “The motive and perpetrators are unknown.”

The Jayapura branch of the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) condemned the explosion as a “terrorist bombing”.

In Sydney, the Australia West Papua Association (AWPA) and Pacific Media Watch in New Zealand protested over the incident and called for a full investigation.

Mambor said he heard the sound of a motorcycle at about 4 am and then an explosion about a minute later.

‘Shook like earthquake’
“It was so loud that my house shook like there was an earthquake,” he told Benar News as reported by Radio Free Asia.

“I also checked the source of the explosion and smelt sulfur coming from the side of the house.”

The explosion left a hole in the road, he said.

The incident was not the first to occur outside Mambor’s home. In April 2021, windows were smashed and paint sprayed on his car in the middle of the night.

Mambor is also an advocate for press freedom in Papua. In that role, he has criticised Jakarta’s restrictions on the media in Papua, as well as its other policies in his troubled home province.

The AJI awarded Mambor its press freedom award in August 2022, saying that through Jubi, “Victor brings more voices from Papua, amid domination of information that is biased, one-sided and discriminatory.”

“AJI in Jayapura strongly condemns the terrorist bombing and considers this an act of intimidation that threatens press freedom in Papua,” it said in a statement.

‘Voice the truth’ call
“AJI Jayapura calls on all journalists in the land of Papua to continue to voice the truth despite obstacles. Justice should be upheld even though the sky is falling,” said AJI chair Lucky Ireeuw.

Amnesty International Indonesia urged the police to find those responsible.

“The police must thoroughly investigate this incident, because this is not the first time … meaning there was an omission that made the perpetrators feel free to do it again, to intimidate and threaten journalists,” Amnesty’s campaign manager in Indonesia, Nurina Savitri, told BenarNews.

The Papua region, located at the eastern end of the Indonesian archipelago, has been the site of a decades-old pro-independence insurgency where both government security forces and rebels have been accused of committing atrocities against civilians.

Foreign journalists have been largely barred from the area, with the government insisting it could not guarantee their safety. Indonesian journalists allege that officials make their work difficult by refusing to provide information.

The armed elements of the independence movement have stepped up lethal attacks on Indonesian security forces, civilians and targets such as construction of a trans-Papua highway that would make the Papuan highlands more accessible.

Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, has accused Indonesian security forces of intimidation, arbitrary arrests, torture, extrajudicial killings and mass forced displacement in Papua.

Security forces kill 36
Last month, Indonesian activist group KontraS said 36 people were killed by security forces and pro-independence rebels in the Papua and West Papua provinces in 2022, an increase from 28 in 2021.

In Sydney, Joe Collins of the AWPA said in a statement: “These acts of intimidation against local journalists in West Papua  threaten freedom of the press.

“It is the local media in West Papua that first report on human rights abuses and local journalists are crucial in reporting information on what is happening in West Papua”.

Collins said Canberra remained silent on the issue — ‘the Australian government is very selective in who it criticises over their human rights record.”

There was no problem raising concerns about China or Russia over their record, “but Canberra seems to have great difficulty in raising the human rights abuses in West Papua with Jakarta.”",Right to healthy and safe environment
217,Thailand,Thailand: two students detained when staging a symbolic protest,27/01/2023,"During a protest at Chiang Mai University yesterday (23 January) to demand the right to bail for political prisoners, police attempted to detain two students and accused them of causing panic and misunderstanding by dressing like inmates.

From 13.00 – 18.12, while graduation ceremony rehearsals were taking place, 7 students participated in a campus-wide performance as part of the protest to demand the release of political prisoners and to back the demands made by activists Tantawan Tuatulanon and Orawan Phuphong when they revoked their own bail on 16 January.

The students were seen walking around campus dressed in an inmate’s uniform with stockings over their heads and chains on their wrists and ankles. At 17.00, they met by Ang Kaew, an on-campus reservoir, where other protesters were standing as part of the protest calling for the right to bail for detained activists and protesters. Water from the reservoir was poured on them, making it look as if they were bleeding as pigment dissolved onto their clothes. A representative of the students also read out Tantawan and Orawan’s demands.

Tantawan and Orawan called for the reform of the judicial system so that human rights and freedom of expression take priority, and so that courts are independent and protect people’s freedom, as well as for judges to make decisions without intervention from their own executives.

They also called for all charges to be dropped against those exercising their freedoms of expression and assembly, and for every political party to guarantee people’s rights, freedoms, and political participation by backing the repeal of the royal defamation law and sedition law.

After no response was made to their demands within the three-day time limit, Tantawan and Orawan announced on 18 January that they would be going on a dry hunger strike and would not request bail for themselves until their demands are met. They were taken to the Department of Corrections Hospital last Friday (20 January) and are now in their 7th day of their hunger strike.

After several reports that the activists wished to be transferred to another hospital or back to the Women’s Central Correctional Institution due to concerns about how staff at the Department of Corrections Hospital might treat them, Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR) reported today (24 January) that the Department of Correction has informed the activists’ lawyer that they would be transferred to the Police Hospital for treatment, but they refused, asking instead to be transferred to Thammasat University Hospital.

TLHR said that Thammasat University Hospital agreed to have Tantawan and Orawan transferred to their facility. At around 19.00 today (24 January), the Department of Corrections issued a statement saying that the two activists will be transferred to Thammasat University Hospital, and TLHR noted that they are still in detention even though they are being transferred to a hospital outside of the authority of the Department of Corrections.

At around 20.00, it was reported that Tantawan and Orawan have arrived at Thammasat University Hospital.
Police attempt to detain students for dressing like inmates

While the students were taking part in yesterdays’ performance at Chiang Mai University, police officers attempted to detain two medical students while they were standing around Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, a teaching hospital in Chiang Mai city affiliated with Chiang Mai University’s Faculty of Medicine. The officers accused the students of causing public panic and making the officers mistake them for inmates from a nearby prison brought to the hospital for treatment. They were taken to a police office in the hospital reprimanded, before a lawyer from Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR)’s Chiang Mai office arrive to negotiate their release. However, corrections officers refused to release the students until they apologize for dressing like an inmate.

Following the incident, the Chiang Mai Central Prison issued a statement addressed to the Department of Corrections saying that they were informed by correction officers guarding sick inmates receiving treatment at the hospital of a group of people dressed like officers and chained inmates, which may damage the Department’s reputation.

218,Thailand,Thailand: prominent pro-democracy lawyer faces disbarment,27/01/2023,"Lawyers for Lawyers again expressed concerns about the disbarment proceedings against lawyer and human rights defender Mr. Arnon Nampha.

Lawyers for Lawyers is concerned about the disbarment proceeding against Mr. Arnon Nampha, a lawyer and human rights defender, that is taking place before the Investigative Committee that was established by the Committee on Professional Ethics of the Lawyers Council of Thailand during the Meeting No. 1/2564 on 13 January 2021.

We were informed that the proceeding against lawyer Arnon Nampha is related to a complaint motion filed to the Lawyers Council of Thailand on 7 August 2020 by the Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister, who alleged that lawyer Arnon Nampha’s behaviour violated the Lawyers Council of Thailand’s disciplinary rules as his behaviour would “incite, intend to cause unrest, distort information and insult on the monarchy”. The speech in question called for reform of the constitution and the monarchy, during a peaceful protest at the Democracy Monument on Ratchadamnoen Avenue on 3 August 2020.

According to our information, a first pre-hearing was postponed twice on 24 November 2021 and 3 March 2022, due to the fact that Mr. Nampha was held in detention pending trial. Therefore, the first pre-hearing was scheduled for 7 April 2022 where both parties appeared before the Investigative Committee to schedule witness examination dates. The Committee scheduled the complainer witness examinations on 2 and 20 June and the complained witness examination on 18 July, 1 and 22 August, and 5 September 2022. However, on 2 June, the complainer failed to attend the first hearing taken place at the LCT. The proceeding therefore was adjourned until 20 June. The next witness examination was scheduled on 11 January 2023 but has been rescheduled to July 2023. After the witness examinations are completed, the Committee will schedule the date to deliver the order.

On 16 June 2022, Lawyers for Lawyers and the Council of Bars and Law Societies of Europe sent a letter to the Thai Authorities expressing their concerns about the disbarment proceedings. Lawyers for Lawyers and the International Commission of Jurists sent a previous letter to the Lawyers Council of Thailand on 1 February 2021, requesting them to dismiss the complaint motion against Mr. Nampha to protect his right to freedom of expression, and the rights of his clients.

222,Bangladesh,"Bangladesh: lawyer tortured, detained for a week",05/02/2023,"

A lawyer who had been missing for a week was brought to a Dhaka court by police, shown arrested, and sent to jail yesterday.

Abu Hossain Rajon was picked up on the morning of January 22, and taken to Hatirjheel Police Station, said his family members.

When the family members met Rajon on the court premises yesterday, he told them that he had been beaten up and tortured in police custody.

""He was battered from the feet up. They beat him everywhere, all over his legs and back. He said that he was taken from the Hatirjheel Police Station to the DB headquarters every day to be tortured,"" said Rajon's younger brother Mohiuddin Khan,.

Rajon was not taken in front of a magistrate at the court, his family alleged. He was brought to the premises, kept in the court's prison cell and taken directly to jail.

""One of our relatives had stood watch over the Hatirjheel police station the whole day [on Saturday]. He saw Rajon being taken out around 5:00pm and being brought back around 11:00pm,"" said Mohiuddin.

""Rajon told us that every day he was taken out for interrogation, they would go through the contact list on his phone and question him about them,"" said Mohiuddin.

""My family had gone [to the police station] with food and clothes, hoping to give those to him. The duty officer kept insisting that he was not there, but Rajon heard our voices and called out,"" the brother told this correspondent. Rajon had reportedly said, ""Sir, I am here, tell them I am here!""

The family also managed to collect a photo of Rajon inside the cell at the police station. ""My father is a retired police officer, and so he has connections,"" said Mohiuddin.

The officer-in-charge of Hatirjheel police station could not be reached for comments in spite of repeated attempts over the phone. Sub-inspector Sharmin told this newspaper that nobody named Abu Hossain Rajon was arrested.

""My brother is accused of causing violence and being involved in anti-state activities. But he is into none of that. He is a lawyer and worked as a human rights activist in our village home in Chatkhil of Noakhali,"" said Mohiuddin.

224,Mongolia,Mongolia: dissident writer detained,02/05/2023,"Ms. Khulan Tsoodol is currently being held in the No. 461 Detention Center in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of the independent country of Mongolia. As a renowned dissident writer, poet, and citizen of this sovereign and democratic country, Khulan was arrested on January 20, 2023 by the General Intelligence Agency of Mongolia on accusations of “being a foreign agent.”

On March 29, 2023, Khulan managed to get an open letter to the people of Mongolia out of the detention center. In this open letter, Khulan reveals that the Mongolian authorities are attempting to criminalize her for “publishing [her] books in Southern Mongolia and for meeting with [her] college friends there to discuss [her] books, other publications, and related matters.”

She is the second prominent dissident writer in the independent democratic country of Mongolia to be accused recently of “being a foreign agent” for their work and activism for the cause of Southern Mongolians living under Chinese colonial occupation. Last February, another Mongolian citizen, the writer, journalist, and human-rights defender Mr. Munkhbayar Chuluundorj, was arrested by the Mongolian General Intelligence Agency and sentenced to 10 years in prison for “collaborating with a foreign intelligence agent to engage in spying activities against the People’s Republic of China.” The “foreign intelligence agent” in this case was Mr. Rajandra Ja Manan, the Second Secretary of the Indian Embassy to Mongolia, who allegedly met with Mr. Chuluundorj to discuss the human-rights situation in Chinese-occupied Southern Mongolia.

The following is an English translation of Ms. Khulan Tsoodol’s open letter, “My Message to My Beloved People.” (English translation by the SMHRIC):

My Message to My Beloved People

It is time for me to tell the truth about the serious accusations of “treason” brought against me, an ordinary, patriotic female writer who loves her nation and her people from the bottom of her heart.

My hope that the Mongolian judiciary system would inform the people of the truth of my “case” after a speedy investigation has been completely shattered. Instead, the authorities have intentionally spread disinformation through news and social media to groundlessly accuse me of being recruited by a foreign intelligence agency to leak state secrets. Via these means, they have attempted to bar me from communicating with the outside world to tell the truth, linking my case with certain issues of Mongolia-China relationship. I have been labeled as a “criminal” and locked up in prison for almost three months. I have been given only a few minutes to talk to my family members and even to my attorney via phone through thick glass and under the close surveillance of the General Intelligence Agency of Mongolia.

My unquestionable love for my nation and my people is deeply ingrained into my writing, my activities, and all my work. Nothing could be more disheartening than seeing the complete betrayal of the hope I expressed in this poem:

    “May my children be kind enough not to cut off the heads of blossoms

    “May my nation be benign enough not to cut off the heads of dissidents”

Now, the bloodthirsty state machinery that suckled on dirty money from oligarchs seems ready to cut my head off.

Before then, I would like to say the following to my people:

    1. I have never been recruited by or worked for any foreign intelligence agency.

    2. I have never had access to any state secrets, let alone leaking them.

    3. All Mongolians know I made a public statement in 2016 to express my opposition to the selection of an oligarch’s son as the 10th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu.

I have been unjustly persecuted due to what I have said, done, and written to defend the interests of my nation. The authorities are desperately attempting to criminalize me for publishing my books in Southern Mongolia and for meeting with my college friends there to discuss my books, other publications, and related matters.

I have been seriously ill and have fallen unconscious multiple times during the interrogation process. Despite my need for immediate hospitalization due to my physical breakdown, I declare that I will go on a hunger strike in defense of my rights. I am ready to give my life if the Mongolian state, engulfed by corruption, needs to sacrifice a woman who loves her people and her nation.",Right to liberty and security
225,Cambodia,Cambodia: union leader bail request again denied (Update),27/01/2023,"The Phnom Penh Municipal Court this morning denied bail to Chhim Sithar, president of the Labor Rights Supported Union of Khmer Employees of Nagaworld (LRSU), ordering her to remain in pre-trial detention in Correctional Center 2 prison. No reason was given for the denial.

Sithar was first arrested in January 2022 and spent two months in pre-trial detention after being charged with incitement alongside other members of her union. She was released on bail in March 2022, but she was again arrested in November by immigration police at the Phnom Penh International Airport while returning from a labour rights conference in Australia.

Authorities accused Sithar of violating bail conditions by leaving the country, despite neither Sithar nor her lawyers ever being informed of such conditions. She has been detained at Correctional Center 2 prison since 26 November 2022.

LRSU members have been striking since December 2021 following mass layoffs at the NagaWorld casino that included the union’s entire leadership and a significant number of members.

Sithar and 8 fellow LRSU leaders and members face up to two years in prison if they are convicted of incitement. Another six LRSU members were charged in February under the 2021 Covid-19 Law. In October, at least 18 additional union members were slapped with charges of breaking and entering; intentionally causing damage with aggravating circumstances; and unlawful arrest, detention and confinement, in a criminal case that also references more than 100 unnamed ""followers"".",Right to liberty and security
226,Cambodia,Cambodia: land rights defender briefly detained,27/01/2023,"Snguon Nhoeun, a Kampong Chhnang land activist, said he was detained for two hours by police after taking photos of a protest outside the provincial court.

Around 50 protesters were lighting incense and praying outside the court on January 18 when he was pushed into a car and had three phones seized, Nhoeun said. Police asked him to delete the images and sign a contract, he said.

“They said I took pictures without permission,” he said. “My arrest is very unfair for me because I was only shooting in public and they arrested me. I think the court has something to hide from me.”

Nhoeun added that he worked as a citizen journalist to cover the activities. Nhoeun is part of the Lor Peang community, which has long been in dispute with KDC International, a company owned by Energy Minister Suy Sem’s wife and accused of bulldozing people’s homes.

“This is a serious threat to me. This act threatens not only me … it threatens other citizens who want to photograph in front of the court,” he said.

Kampong Chhnang Provincial Court spokesperson Hak Kimhong denied that any arrests had been made. He said that authorities had only held him to explain some problems. He said the reason why the police detained and confiscated the phone was because Nhoeun was broadcasting live in front of the court without permission so the prosecutor ordered a temporary confiscation.

“I would like to deny his arrest. It is not true. We just explained to him where to shoot and where not to shoot.”

Kampong Chhnang Provincial Police spokesperson Ear Bunthoeun declined to comment on the case, saying the order to detain Nhoeun was made by the prosecutor’s office.

227,Viet Nam,Vietnam: blogger indicted after investigation is completed (Update),05/02/2023,"Hanoi police said that they completed an investigation into the case of prominent blogger Nguyen Lan Thang, who was arrested in July, and recommended he be charged with spreading anti-state information.

Le Van Luan, one of Thang’s two defense lawyers, told RFA on Friday that they received a notice saying that “the investigation was completed by Jan. 17.” The lawyer added that both defense counsels have registered to represent Thang. 

Born in 1975, Nguyen is a human rights activist who blogged for RFA’s Vietnamese Service. His wife, Le Bich Vuong, said that neither she nor his two lawyers have been able to speak with him or see him since his arrest on July 5.

“Our family hasn’t had any information about him and hasn’t been allowed to see him. Neither have his lawyers,” she said. 

Police announced that they recommended Thang be charged with “creating, storing, disseminating or propagandizing information, materials, items, and publications against the Socialist Republic of Vietnam” under Article 117 of Vietnam’s Penal Code.

Vuong said her family was allowed each week to send him food and personal items purchased directly from the prison. She said she was very worried about his health as he has asthma. The detention center did not allow her to send him medicine. 

Investigators also told her family that Thang had complained of bone pain and blurred vision.

Academic family

Nguyen Lan Thang is from a well-known academic family in Vietnam, and his grandfather wrote a popular Vietnamese dictionary.

Thang is both a writer and an activist, beginning in 2011 with protests against China’s maritime incursions in the South China Sea.

He was arrested in 2013, and in 2014 authorities forbade him from traveling to the United States to attend a World Press Freedom Day ceremony held by UNESCO. 

He has contributed articles as an independent commentator to RFA’s Vietnamese Service since 2013 on topics such as freedom, democracy and human rights. He also actively posted on his personal Facebook page.

Blocked from lawyers

His wife, Vuong, said she was told by police that Thang could only be allowed visitors, including his lawyers, once the police investigation was complete because he is accused of a national security violation.

“It’s extremely unreasonable,” Vuong told RFA. “Article 117 is very vague … I don’t think he has done any harm to the country’s interests.” 

Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia Division, said Thang faces a long prison term for simply expressing viewpoints on Facebook that the ruling Communist party doesn't like.

""Vietnam's campaign to censor critical views and put activists behind bars is not slowing down one iota despite the political unrest and official resignations at the top of the government,” Robertson said.

“Arresting people on ludicrous charges like ‘conducting anti-state propaganda’ is not a sign of strength but rather an indication of weakness,” he said, “and only goes to show just how politically paranoid Vietnam's ruling dictatorship really is about members of the public pointing out the regime's faults.”",Right to fair trial

228,Indonesia,Indonesia: environmental defender sentenced,26/02/2023,"The Indonesian authorities should immediately release Robison Saul, a fisherman and activist on Sangihe Island in North Sulawesi province, and quash his politically motivated conviction, Human Rights Watch said today. A court on January 17, 2023, convicted Saul under an emergency law of possessing a knife at a protest and sentenced him to nine months in prison.

The police arrested Saul, 45, on June 30, 2022, after two weeks of protests and roadblocks organized by villagers on Sangihe Island against the gold mining company PT Tambang Mas Sangihe. The company is an Indonesian subsidiary of the Vancouver-based Baru Gold Corp., which has been involved in a legal dispute in its effort to mine gold from the small island.

After his arrest, Saul spent months in pretrial detention. Police and prison officials repeatedly obstructed lawyers and family members’ access to him, and prison guards allegedly beat him repeatedly between September 28 and October 1, according to his wife and his lawyers.

“Indonesian police and prosecutors brought a politically motivated case against a local fisherman who participated in anti-mining protests, claiming a knife that is a tool of his trade somehow justifies abusive pretrial detention and a prison sentence,” said Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The authorities on Sangihe Island should immediately quash Robison Saul’s conviction and release him, and provide him with adequate compensation for his mistreatment.”

In January 2021, Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources granted PT Tambang Mas Sangihe a license to explore and mine approximately 420 square kilometers – an area about half the size of New York City – on Sangihe Island for 33 years. The North Sulawesi provincial government, which administers the island, also issued the company a permit.

The concession area constitutes about 57 percent of the island’s landmass and overlaps with 80 villages, according to the nongovernmental organization Jatam; it also encompasses a forest area called Sahendarumang, which serves as a water source for local residents. Most residents of Sangihe rely on farming and traditional fishing for their livelihoods.

The two licenses prompted the islanders to organize the Save Sangihe Island coalition and sue the government at the administration courts in Jakarta and Manado, the North Sulawesi capital. The islanders contended that the licenses should be revoked because they contravene Indonesia’s Marine Law, which allows issuing a mining license only on islands bigger than 2,000 square kilometers. Sangihe Island is fewer than 750 square kilometers.

In June 2022, the Manado administrative court ruled in favor of the 56 Sangihe women who had filed the petition, ordering the provincial government to revoke the permit and the company to stop their activities. Among other grounds, the court found that the mine’s environmental impact analysis did not meet legal requirements. Specifically, the assessment had failed to consult an appropriate number of residents and also failed to provide them with adequate information about all the likely environmental impacts associated with the mining operations.

In September, the Jakarta administrative high court ruled against the government, directing the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources to revoke the permit. But the police and the prosecutors have not carried out the ruling.

In August, the company filed a lawsuit against the Indonesian government, including President Joko Widodo and several cabinet members, seeking damages of IDR 1 trillion (US$64 million) for cancelling the project. The Supreme Court ruled against the company in January 2023.

PT Tambang Mas Sangihe has continued to move forward with its mining operations on the island. It stated in a news release that it intends to apply for a new permit, contending that: “Sangihe Island has a history of rampant illegal mining that has heavily polluted the environment, including the dumping of mine tailings into the ocean, reefs, and mangroves, and the polluting of the river and ocean with mercury. These illegal miners have had no permits and are largely not residents of Sangihe Island.”

The company announced that since October 2021 it has been clearing land, constructing waste dumps, and building a processing plant area and associated access roads. It sent bulldozers, drillers, and multiple other heavy machines to the island, moving them via 10-wheel trucks from a small port to the company’s base camp in Bowone village.

Many islanders responded to the company’s actions, which they consider to be in defiance of court rulings, by blocking the trucks.

On June 14, 2022, Saul, who had just returned from fishing, joined a peaceful roadblock set up by hundreds of villagers who were trying to stop several mining trucks that were heading to Bowone village.

Saul carried his knife, a pisau besi putih (white steel knife) commonly used by fisherman to cut nets or lines at sea, inside its pouch. A soldier prevented Saul from climbing onto a truck, and as he did so, he found the knife in Saul’s pocket. He confiscated it, and later handed it to the police.

The police kept the knife but they did not charge Saul at the time. The villagers maintained the roadblock for another two weeks and during that time, another police officer called Saul and told him to dissociate himself from the Save Sangihe Island movement. Saul refused. The police summoned him to their station on June 30, and immediately arrested him.

His lawyer, Adhitiya Augusta Triputra of the Jakarta Legal Aid Institute, said Saul was interrogated twice without any legal representative. His wife and lawyers reported they had serious difficulties in meeting with Saul in custody.

Prison officials refused to let the lawyers meet with him because the officials claimed they didn’t have permission from the Sangihe district court. Saul informed his lawyers that four prison guards beat him repeatedly inside the Tahuna prison on Sangihe Island between September 28 and October 1. The lawyers said Saul was shoved inside a bathroom, causing his head to hit the toilet, resulting in serious bleeding. The authorities failed to give him medical treatment for his injuries.

“Indonesia’s Ministry of Law and Human Rights should urgently investigate the alleged beating of Robison Saul inside the Sangihe prison as well as efforts to block his access to legal counsel,” Harsono said. “Saul’s prosecution appears intended to intimidate him and other villagers to accept a mining project that many oppose because of the serious threat to their livelihoods and way of life.”",Freedom of assembly

It sent bulldozers, drillers, and multiple other heavy machines to the island, moving them via 10-wheel trucks from a small port to the company’s base camp in Bowone village.

Many islanders responded to the company’s actions, which they consider to be in defiance of court rulings, by blocking the trucks.

On June 14, 2022, Saul, who had just returned from fishing, joined a peaceful roadblock set up by hundreds of villagers who were trying to stop several mining trucks that were heading to Bowone village.

Saul carried his knife, a pisau besi putih (white steel knife) commonly used by fisherman to cut nets or lines at sea, inside its pouch. A soldier prevented Saul from climbing onto a truck, and as he did so, he found the knife in Saul’s pocket. He confiscated it, and later handed it to the police.

The police kept the knife but they did not charge Saul at the time. The villagers maintained the roadblock for another two weeks and during that time, another police officer called Saul and told him to dissociate himself from the Save Sangihe Island movement. Saul refused. The police summoned him to their station on June 30, and immediately arrested him.

His lawyer, Adhitiya Augusta Triputra of the Jakarta Legal Aid Institute, said Saul was interrogated twice without any legal representative. His wife and lawyers reported they had serious difficulties in meeting with Saul in custody.

Prison officials refused to let the lawyers meet with him because the officials claimed they didn’t have permission from the Sangihe district court. Saul informed his lawyers that four prison guards beat him repeatedly inside the Tahuna prison on Sangihe Island between September 28 and October 1. The lawyers said Saul was shoved inside a bathroom, causing his head to hit the toilet, resulting in serious bleeding. The authorities failed to give him medical treatment for his injuries.

“Indonesia’s Ministry of Law and Human Rights should urgently investigate the alleged beating of Robison Saul inside the Sangihe prison as well as efforts to block his access to legal counsel,” Harsono said. “Saul’s prosecution appears intended to intimidate him and other villagers to accept a mining project that many oppose because of the serious threat to their livelihoods and way of life.”",Right to Protest
228,Indonesia,Indonesia: environmental defender sentenced,26/02/2023,"The Indonesian authorities should immediately release Robison Saul, a fisherman and activist on Sangihe Island in North Sulawesi province, and quash his politically motivated conviction, Human Rights Watch said today. A court on January 17, 2023, convicted Saul under an emergency law of possessing a knife at a protest and sentenced him to nine months in prison.

The police arrested Saul, 45, on June 30, 2022, after two weeks of protests and roadblocks organized by villagers on Sangihe Island against the gold mining company PT Tambang Mas Sangihe. The company is an Indonesian subsidiary of the Vancouver-based Baru Gold Corp., which has been involved in a legal dispute in its effort to mine gold from the small island.

After his arrest, Saul spent months in pretrial detention. Police and prison officials repeatedly obstructed lawyers and family members’ access to him, and prison guards allegedly beat him repeatedly between September 28 and October 1, according to his wife and his lawyers.

“Indonesian police and prosecutors brought a politically motivated case against a local fisherman who participated in anti-mining protests, claiming a knife that is a tool of his trade somehow justifies abusive pretrial detention and a prison sentence,” said Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The authorities on Sangihe Island should immediately quash Robison Saul’s conviction and release him, and provide him with adequate compensation for his mistreatment.”

In January 2021, Indonesia’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources granted PT Tambang Mas Sangihe a license to explore and mine approximately 420 square kilometers – an area about half the size of New York City – on Sangihe Island for 33 years. The North Sulawesi provincial government, which administers the island, also issued the company a permit.

The concession area constitutes about 57 percent of the island’s landmass and overlaps with 80 villages, according to the nongovernmental organization Jatam; it also encompasses a forest area called Sahendarumang, which serves as a water source for local residents. Most residents of Sangihe rely on farming and traditional fishing for their livelihoods.

The two licenses prompted the islanders to organize the Save Sangihe Island coalition and sue the government at the administration courts in Jakarta and Manado, the North Sulawesi capital. The islanders contended that the licenses should be revoked because they contravene Indonesia’s Marine Law, which allows issuing a mining license only on islands bigger than 2,000 square kilometers. Sangihe Island is fewer than 750 square kilometers.

In June 2022, the Manado administrative court ruled in favor of the 56 Sangihe women who had filed the petition, ordering the provincial government to revoke the permit and the company to stop their activities. Among other grounds, the court found that the mine’s environmental impact analysis did not meet legal requirements. Specifically, the assessment had failed to consult an appropriate number of residents and also failed to provide them with adequate information about all the likely environmental impacts associated with the mining operations.

In September, the Jakarta administrative high court ruled against the government, directing the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources to revoke the permit. But the police and the prosecutors have not carried out the ruling.

In August, the company filed a lawsuit against the Indonesian government, including President Joko Widodo and several cabinet members, seeking damages of IDR 1 trillion (US$64 million) for cancelling the project. The Supreme Court ruled against the company in January 2023.

PT Tambang Mas Sangihe has continued to move forward with its mining operations on the island. It stated in a news release that it intends to apply for a new permit, contending that: “Sangihe Island has a history of rampant illegal mining that has heavily polluted the environment, including the dumping of mine tailings into the ocean, reefs, and mangroves, and the polluting of the river and ocean with mercury. These illegal miners have had no permits and are largely not residents of Sangihe Island.”

The company announced that since October 2021 it has been clearing land, constructing waste dumps, and building a processing plant area and associated access roads. It sent bulldozers, drillers, and multiple other heavy machines to the island, moving them via 10-wheel trucks from a small port to the company’s base camp in Bowone village.

229,Pakistan,Pakistan: human rights lawyer gunned down,26/01/2023,"The respected lawyer and human rights defender Abdul Latif Afridi was shot and killed inside the Peshawar High Court on Monday. Affectionately known as Lala (meaning elder brother in Pashto), Afridi, 79, was one of Pakistan’s most courageous and outspoken voices for rule of law, democracy, and human rights over several decades.

The alleged gunman, a junior lawyer, was arrested at the scene.

Afridi’s activist career began as a student leader in the 1960s when he was expelled from Peshawar University for denouncing sham elections under the military dictatorship of Gen. Ayub Khan. After becoming an attorney, he represented many victims of enforced disappearances and their families. He was a vocal critic of religious militancy and extremism. He was never intimidated into silence, despite numerous threats to his life and several times suffering imprisonment and torture.

In 2007, he led a lawyers’ protest against then-president Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, and was struck by a police armored personnel carrier, fracturing his leg.

Afridi was a passionate opponent of the Frontiers Crime Regulation, a draconian British colonial-era law governing the former tribal areas of Pakistan that permitted collective punishments and denied defendants basic due process rights, including the right to legal counsel. Thanks in part to his advocacy, the law was repealed in 2018.

He was a former member of the Pakistan’s National Assembly and a former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association.

My introduction to Afridi was through Asma Jahangir and I.A. Rehman, late icons of the human rights movement in Pakistan. What struck me most about Lala was that despite working under great stress, he retained his wit and charm and always found time for the younger generation of human rights activists and lawyers. His loss is a devastating blow for the human rights movement in Pakistan and for all Pakistanis who stand for rule of law, equality, and democracy.

The most fitting tribute to Lala Latif Afridi is to continue his struggle for a tolerant, rights-respecting Pakistan.",Right to life

231,Philippines,Philippines: youth group office raided at night,17/01/2023,"Youth progressive group Anakbayan said that unidentified individuals entered their national office at around 9 p.m. yesterday, January 15.

“Cellphones were not where they were left, tables were moved, windows are open, doors show clear signs of forced entry,” said Anakbayan in their post via their social media accounts.

Later that day, at around midnight, the youth group also stated that some of their members noticed police mobile roaming around the area.

“We fear for our safety. This attempt to enter our office is not detached from what happened to Dyan and Armand in Cebu,” said Jeann Miranda, chairperson of Anakbayan, referring to two Cebu-based activists, Dyan Gumanao, 28, coordinator of Alliance of Concerned Teachers-Region 7, and Armand Dayoha, 27, Alliance of Health Workers-Cebu coordinator, who were reported missing after spending the holidays with their families.

Before their absence, the two reported a series of harassment and tailing. As of this writing, the two have not been found.

Attacks against the youth

Anakbayan has been subjected to relentless attacks under several administrations.

One of the most notable cases is Anakbayan member and student activist Alicia Lucena, whose mother, Relissa, a member of Hands Off Our Children Network, filed a kidnapping and human trafficking case against the youth group along with former Kabataan Representative Sarah Elago and former Bayan Muna representative Neri Colmenares.

However, Lucena goes against Relissa’s statement through a video narrating how her mother illegally detained her at home, prevented her from watching television, and contacted friends and fellow activists.

Aside from this, Jovita Antoniano and the Philippine National Police (PNP) filed kidnapping and child abuse charges against Anakbayan leaders. However, last May 28, the Department of Justice (DOJ) released a 15-page resolution junking the charges due to the ‘lack of probable cause.’

The most recent case was last December 29, where Anakbayan, along with progressive groups such as Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU) and Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (BAYAN)’’s Facebook pages, were removed.

The accounts’ administrators and editors have also been locked due to ‘unknown entities trying to access the accounts.’

Prior to this incident, the group’s posts giving tribute to Jose Maria Sison had been flagged for violating the “Community Standards.”

“We are condemning this action made by Facebook because it’s just an attempt to silence the free speech of the youth. Sharing Prof. Jose Maria Sison’s contribution to the freedom and equality of the Filipino should not be considered a threat or terrorism,” said Anakbayan.

Anakbayan called for the youth and other human rights organizations to stand up and condemn the series of harassment against the youth.

“There is no one to blame but the state who wants to silence those fighting for their freedom and rights. We call for the youth, human rights watch, and even the Commission on Human Rights to help us look into what happened. This incident also fuels us to fight the oppressive and corrupt Marcos Jr,” said Miranda.",Right to healthy and safe environment

233,China,China: pro-democracy defender formally indicted (Update),27/01/2023,"On January 14, the contents of Ji Xiaolong’s indictment letter, a well-known Shanghai human rights activist, were revealed. According to the recent disclosure, the official judiciary arrested Mr. Ji during the COVID lockdown for criticizing the country’s leaders. Authorities recently resumed his case for supplementary investigation.

 
COVID in China

On the afternoon of January 11, 2023, Ji Xiaolong’s lawyer met with him at the Pudong Detention Center in Shanghai. According to the information released by Mr. Ji Xiaolong Concern Group, the lawyer told Ji about the situation of COVID in China, saying that the country has been fully reopened and many people have been infected. Ji Xiaolong noted that he was once infected in the detention center. At that time, he had pain all over his body and came down with a fever, but the detention center did not provide him with medications for treatment.

 
Refused treatment

Sources disclosed that the detention center did not arrange for Ji Xiaolong to visit the dentist. The month Ji Xiaolong was arrested, the dentist gave a medical opinion and suggested periodontitis treatment; otherwise, he would not be able to receive dental implants in the future.

 
Potential charges

Ji Xiaolong read the prosecution’s opinion document to his lawyer. The main content has two aspects: one of them being Ji speaking out for relevant protests during the lockdown, and the official said he’s suspected of fabricating rumors. The other was the authorities stating that Ji Xiaolong was suspected of insulting the country’s leader. The specific details will only be revealed after the lawyer reads the document. Ji Xiaolong’s case was returned for supplementary investigation on January 5, and the lawyers will not be able to review the case until February 5.

 
Further investigation

In terms of procedure, Ji’s case has reached the prosecution stage in the People’s Procuratorate but has been returned for supplementary investigation. According to the relevant provisions of Chinese law, if, within one month, the prosecutor believes that the evidence of the case is insufficient, it does not meet the requirements for prosecution, the court will decide not to prosecute. In the case of the second supplementary investigation, if the prosecutor still believes that the evidence is insufficient and does not meet the requirements for prosecution, it may make a decision not to prosecute.

 

 
His work during zero-Covid

During the complete lockdown of Shanghai in April, Ji Xiaolong posted a letter on Weibo, WeChat, and Twitter on April 2, “Immediately stop the campaign-style disease prevention, relieve difficulties and send relief ——Shanghai Citizens’ Petition for the People.” It has been widely distributed and received widespread attention. He also sent a letter to Li Qiang, the Party Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee at the time, who later joined and is now a member of China’s most powerful committee. Ji raised the question of accountability for the excessive COVID prevention policy in the early stage in Shanghai.

 

His efforts all fall within the category of freedom of speech stipulated in the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China and are based on the most foundational humanitarian considerations.

 

After that, he organized volunteers in Shanghai to solve the difficulties and resolve the worries of citizens, aided migrant workers who had nowhere to live and offered legal assistance to citizens who were in severe economic difficulties due to covid lockdown.

 
Detained

For these reasons, Mr. Ji was summoned and detained by the Shanghai police many times and was taken away from his home by the police on August 31, 2022; on September 2 of the same year, he was formally placed under criminal detention by the police again; The People’s Procuratorate approved the arrest on suspicion of “picking quarrels and provoking troubles,” and he was detained in Shanghai Pudong Detention Center.",Right to fair trial

For these reasons, Mr. Ji was summoned and detained by the Shanghai police many times and was taken away from his home by the police on August 31, 2022; on September 2 of the same year, he was formally placed under criminal detention by the police again; The People’s Procuratorate approved the arrest on suspicion of “picking quarrels and provoking troubles,” and he was detained in Shanghai Pudong Detention Center.",Right to liberty and security
233,China,China: pro-democracy defender formally indicted (Update),27/01/2023,"On January 14, the contents of Ji Xiaolong’s indictment letter, a well-known Shanghai human rights activist, were revealed. According to the recent disclosure, the official judiciary arrested Mr. Ji during the COVID lockdown for criticizing the country’s leaders. Authorities recently resumed his case for supplementary investigation.

 
COVID in China

On the afternoon of January 11, 2023, Ji Xiaolong’s lawyer met with him at the Pudong Detention Center in Shanghai. According to the information released by Mr. Ji Xiaolong Concern Group, the lawyer told Ji about the situation of COVID in China, saying that the country has been fully reopened and many people have been infected. Ji Xiaolong noted that he was once infected in the detention center. At that time, he had pain all over his body and came down with a fever, but the detention center did not provide him with medications for treatment.

 
Refused treatment

Sources disclosed that the detention center did not arrange for Ji Xiaolong to visit the dentist. The month Ji Xiaolong was arrested, the dentist gave a medical opinion and suggested periodontitis treatment; otherwise, he would not be able to receive dental implants in the future.

 
Potential charges

Ji Xiaolong read the prosecution’s opinion document to his lawyer. The main content has two aspects: one of them being Ji speaking out for relevant protests during the lockdown, and the official said he’s suspected of fabricating rumors. The other was the authorities stating that Ji Xiaolong was suspected of insulting the country’s leader. The specific details will only be revealed after the lawyer reads the document. Ji Xiaolong’s case was returned for supplementary investigation on January 5, and the lawyers will not be able to review the case until February 5.

 
Further investigation

In terms of procedure, Ji’s case has reached the prosecution stage in the People’s Procuratorate but has been returned for supplementary investigation. According to the relevant provisions of Chinese law, if, within one month, the prosecutor believes that the evidence of the case is insufficient, it does not meet the requirements for prosecution, the court will decide not to prosecute. In the case of the second supplementary investigation, if the prosecutor still believes that the evidence is insufficient and does not meet the requirements for prosecution, it may make a decision not to prosecute.

 

 
His work during zero-Covid

During the complete lockdown of Shanghai in April, Ji Xiaolong posted a letter on Weibo, WeChat, and Twitter on April 2, “Immediately stop the campaign-style disease prevention, relieve difficulties and send relief ——Shanghai Citizens’ Petition for the People.” It has been widely distributed and received widespread attention. He also sent a letter to Li Qiang, the Party Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee at the time, who later joined and is now a member of China’s most powerful committee. Ji raised the question of accountability for the excessive COVID prevention policy in the early stage in Shanghai.

 

His efforts all fall within the category of freedom of speech stipulated in the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China and are based on the most foundational humanitarian considerations.

 

After that, he organized volunteers in Shanghai to solve the difficulties and resolve the worries of citizens, aided migrant workers who had nowhere to live and offered legal assistance to citizens who were in severe economic difficulties due to covid lockdown.

234,Cambodia,"Cambodia: youth, environmentalists under surveillance",27/01/2023,"Youth environmental activists advocating against the development of a Koh Kong island say they are facing threats and surveillance after authorities blocked an advocacy push at a Royal University of Phnom Penh event earlier this month.

A group of about 50 young activists organized a stall at an RUPP event in mid-January selling coconuts, providing leaflets and talks on the potential development of Koh Kong Krao island in Koh Kong province. Activists from Mother Nature and Khmer Thavrak have advocated for the government to refrain from leasing the island for development.

The stall — which was set up during the 63rd anniversary celebrations of the university — was shut down by district officials and university staff who considered it against university policies, activists said. 

Since then, the activists allege they have faced surveillance from local authorities. 

Phuon Keoreaksmey, a fourth-year university student and a Mother Nature activist, said the group was initially allowed to set up the stall in the university premises during the anniversary celebrations hosted from January 13th to 15th.

But on the first day of the event, local authorities and the university’s rector summoned them for a meeting and said they had to close down the stall and were banned from distributing any leaflets with messages about Koh Kong Krao island.

“They dare not to follow their own decision and work based on the advice of another person,” she said.

Kim Chilin, a Mother Nature activist and RUPP student, said authorities were monitoring his residence and even following him since then. He said this was a threat and aimed at affecting the morale of activists advocating for environmental rights.

“Me and my friends were followed by authorities to our homes. This is a kind of threat. For me, I think that it should not have happened to me,” he said. 

Last month, activists also distributed pamphlets and held banners at the university’s Institute for Foreign Languages, urging authorities to not allow the development of the island. The Environment Ministry in 2020 said it was assessing whether to allow for development of the island, which was granted to notorious tycoon Ly Yong Phat, who got the development rights to the island in 2019.

Men Sreydav, another activist who was part of the advocacy effort, said authorities began following members of the group as soon as they distributed the leaflets.

“Generally, they followed us to our houses after our dissemination activities. I am worried about my safety because I always come out to do activities,” he said. 

VOD could not reach Phnom Penh City Hall spokesperson Met Measpheakdey and Tuol Kork deputy district governor Teav Sam Oeun denied the accusations.

“I would like to deny that authority did not threaten them,” he said. “Whenever they have proper permission, we will cooperate immediately.”

235,Pakistan,Pakistan: media worker arrested for exposing military asset,05/02/2023,"Pakistan authorities must immediately and unconditionally release journalist Shahid Aslam and allow the media to freely and independently report on military officials, the Committee to Protect Journalists said Tuesday.

On January 13, Federal Investigation Agency officers in Lahore arrested Aslam, a special correspondent for the privately owned broadcaster BOL News, according to news reports and a statement by the Pakistan Press Foundation, a local press freedom group.

Authorities accused Aslam of involvement in a November 19, 2022, article in the independent news website FactFocus that used leaked tax data to report on the assets of former Pakistan army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa and his family, those sources said. FactFocus correspondent Ahmad Noorani told CPJ via messaging app Aslam was not involved in that article.

On Monday, an Islamabad court ordered Aslam to be transferred to jail while he awaits trial, according to Pakistani journalist Umar Cheema, who is familiar with the case and spoke with CPJ via messaging app. CPJ was unable to determine what charges have been filed against Aslam.

“The arrest of reporter Shahid Aslam underscores the dangerous environment for journalists in Pakistan,” said Beh Lih Yi, CPJ’s Asia program coordinator. “Authorities must immediately and unconditionally release Aslam and respect his right to privacy and the confidentiality of his sources as guaranteed under the country’s journalist safety law.”

During his detention, FIA officers pressured Aslam to disclose the password to his laptop, which he refused, according to those news reports and the Pakistan Press Foundation’s statement.

The country’s Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Bill, 2021, includes provisions that protect journalists’ right to privacy and the confidentiality of their sources.

CPJ emailed the Federal Investigation Agency for comment, but did not receive any response. CPJ was unable to immediately find contact information for Bajwa.

Since January 12, journalists throughout Kazakhstan have seen their cars set on fire, apartments attacked, and offices vandalized, according to media reports and journalists who spoke to CPJ. Police have detained five suspects in relation to two of those incidents.

“While Kazakh police should be applauded for their swift work in apprehending suspects in two recent attacks on journalists, authorities must ensure that all the recent instances of harassment against the press are thoroughly investigated and that those who ordered them are held to account,” said Gulnoza Said, CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia program coordinator, in New York. “Authorities’ rhetoric about a ‘new Kazakhstan’ will remain empty words unless they are able to ensure journalists’ safety.”

On January 12, attackers smashed the glass entrance to an office building that houses the independent outlet Elmedia in the southern city of Almaty, according to media reports and posts on Facebook by Elmedia editor-in-chief Gulzhan Yergalieva, which said that it was the sixth such attack on the outlet’s office since October.

Elmedia covers politics on its YouTube channel, where it has about 100,000 subscribers.

Since August, people have also filed false reports to police about bombs in Elmedia’s office and Yergalieva’s home and car, sent the journalist a funeral wreath, and placed her phone number and photo on websites advertising sexual services.

In messages sent to Elmedia’s Telegram account and posted by Yergalieva on Facebook, individuals who claimed to have carried out the attacks threatened “maybe the next brick will be to your forehead,” and told the outlet to “put a muzzle on” Yergalieva, “otherwise we will shut her up.”

Separately, on the night of January 13, a vehicle belonging to independent journalist Dinara Yegeubayeva was set on fire in Almaty, according to news reports and a post by the journalist on Instagram.

Yegeubayeva, who is also a political activist, said in an interview with independent journalist Vadim Boreiko that she believes the attack was related to her journalistic posts on Instagram and YouTube, where she has a combined 94,000 subscribers and has covered allegations of rights abuses by authorities during 2022 mass protests in Kazakhstan and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Police have arrested five suspects aged between 15 and 17 who confessed to carrying out the arson attack on Yegeubayeva’s car and the most recent attacks on Elmedia, saying they were paid to commit them by unidentified individuals who contacted them on the internet, news reports said.

Separately, on January 16, unidentified individuals injected construction foam around the apartment door of Gulnara Bazhkenova, chief editor of the independent news website Orda, in Almaty, for the third time since September, the journalist told CPJ by phone and wrote on Facebook. Bazhkenova said unidentified people also mailed her a tombstone featuring her image and the date “2023” in December, and that her outlet’s website has faced consistent distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks since July 2022.

Also, on January 18, hackers infiltrated the website of the independent news website Ulysmedia, based in the capital city of Astana, and placed the personal data of chief editor Samal Ibrayeva and her children online, according to news reports and a statement by the journalist posted on Telegram.

Following the doxxing, unidentified users flooded Ulysmedia’s social media accounts with an identical message, saying: “This is just the start of your new life full of pain and sorrow. We know about everything that you hold dear.”

Ibrayeva told CPJ by messaging app that Ulysmedia’s website and social media accounts have repeatedly been targeted by DDoS and spam attacks since July 2022.

Separately, in the early hours of January 19, unidentified attackers injected construction foam around the door of journalist Vadim Boreiko’s apartment in Almaty and wrote graffiti featuring a lewd image and the name of Boreiko’s YouTube channel, according to news reports and a Facebook post by the journalist.

Ibrayeva and Boreyko told CPJ that they had not received any information about the suspects in their cases.

Bazhkenova told CPJ police arrested two young people in November who admitted to some of the previous harassment of Orda and Elmedia, and who told police they had also been paid by unidentified individuals who contacted them online.

On January 20, a spokesperson for Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev wrote on Facebook that the president had ordered a “thorough investigation” into the attacks on journalists, saying that “not only the perpetrators, but also those who ordered these illegal acts” must be identified.

237,Kyrgyzstan,Kyrgyzstan: blogger sent to prison,15/01/2023,"A Kyrgyz blogger known for his critical reports of authorities has been detained after the Bishkek City Court canceled his three-year parole-like probation.

Adilet Ali Myktybek, known on social media as Alibek Baltabai, was sentenced to five years in prison in November on a charge of calling for social unrest via the internet, allegations he has called politically motivated.

The court ruled at the time that Myktybek would not have to serve his prison sentence immediately, but instead would be under a three-year parole-like probation period. If he served that period without any violations, the court said his five-year prison term would be canceled.

The blogger's lawyer, Taken Moldokulov, told RFE/RL that the Bishkek City Court's decision January 12 to send his client to a penal colony was made at the request of prosecutors who considered Myktybek's sentence too lenient.

Moldokulov added that the court annulled the probation part of the sentence leaving the five-year prison term without changes.

""The Penitentiary Service is expected to inform us where exactly Adilet Baltabai will be serving his term,"" Moldokulov said, adding that the court decision will be appealed.

Myktybek was detained in late June last year after he was questioned by Bishkek police for a third time since May about his coverage of rallies by civil rights activists.

Following his release in November, Myktybek continued his blogging activities and took part in a rally January 10 to express support for 26 jailed Kyrgyzstan politicians and activists arrested in October for protesting a border deal with Uzbekistan.

Myktybek has been known for actively covering anti-government rallies and pickets in the Central Asian nation.

He is also a freelance correspondent for the Next television channel, whose director, Taalaibek Duishembiev, was handed a suspended three-year prison sentence in September after a court found him guilty of inciting interethnic hatred by airing a controversial report related to Russia’s war in Ukraine.",Right to liberty and security

Police forced the men and women onto buses and took them to police stations while they were holding a rally near Bishkek's Gorky Park on January 10 demanding the release of the jailed politicians and activists.

Several journalists who covered the rally-- including a reporter for RFE/RL's Kyrgyz Service -- were detained along with the demonstrators, but released shortly afterwards. Others were released hours later.

Kyrgyz authorities arrested 26 members of the so-called Kempir-Abad Defense Committee in late October after they protested against the Kyrgyz-Uzbek border demarcation deal which saw Kyrgyzstan in November hand over the territory of the Kempir-Abad water reservoir, comprising 4,485 hectares, to Uzbekistan in exchange for over 19,000 hectares elsewhere.

Those arrested were charged with planning riots over the border agreement, which was more than three decades in the making.

Seventeen of those detained have been on a hunger strike for a week.

In November, the presidents of the two Central Asian nations signed the controversial deal into law after lawmakers in both countries approved it.

The Kempir-Abad reservoir, known in Uzbekistan as the Andijon reservoir, was built in 1983. It is located in the fertile Ferghana Valley and represents a vital regional water source. Uzbekistan, whose population of 35 million is five times larger than that of Kyrgyzstan, uses most of the water from the area.

Many Kyrgyz civil activists, opposition politicians, and residents living close to the dam have been against the deal, saying Uzbekistan should continue to be allowed to use the water, but the reservoir's land should remain within Kyrgyzstan.

239,Philippines,Philippines: two defenders go missing,17/01/2023,"Dyan Gumanao, 28, coordinator of Alliance of Concerned Teachers-Region 7 and Armand Dayoha, 27, Alliance of Health Workers-Cebu coordinator were expected to arrive in their offices on Jan. 10 after spending the holidays with their families but have not been able to show up or contact family and colleagues since then.

According to Karapatan-Central Visayas, Gumanao and Dayoha had previously reported a series of harassment and tailing, which had increased following Gumanao’s arrest on June 5, 2020 as part of the Cebu 8.

Both Gumanao and Dayoha had also been tailed by suspected state agents after a Mendiola Massacre commemoration protest on January 22, 2021.

“These irregularities that they have observed have been considered to be possible monitoring of the two of them as active development workers and long-time human rights advocates in Cebu,” Karapatan-Central Visayas wrote in their statement.

The group added that Gumano had also experienced numerous instances of tailing by suspected state forces in the last quarter of 2022.

Gumanao had previously served as the head coordinator of Aninaw Productions and had been a key figure in its revival in 2017. Prior to that, she had been the chairperson of the UP Cebu University Student Council of the University of the Philippines Cebu (UP Cebu) and served as the Vice President for Visayas of the National Union of Students of the Philippines (NUSP).

After graduating cum laude with a Mass Communication degree from the university, Gumanao joined the non-government organization Community Empowerment Resource Network (CERNET) as a Special Support Services Coordinator.

She currently serves as a volunteer coordinator for the Alliance of Concerned Teachers-Region 7 after having been a volunteer for several years.

Dayoha, meanwhile, graduated from the Psychology program of UP Cebu and has served as a National Service Training Program (NSTP) lecturer in the university since 2015. He has also been pursuing a bachelor in Fine Arts as a second degree.

Having been active in the pursuit of “art for the people,” he was one of the founding members of the Cebu-based cultural group Art and Tankard Organization (ATO).

During the height of the pandemic in 2020, Dayoha was cited to be one of the key volunteers in addressing the issues of the workers and the urban poor in Mandaue City. He eventually became a staff member of the non-government organization Visayas Human Development Agency, Inc. (VIHDA, Inc.).

Dayoha currently serves as the coordinator of the Alliance of Health Workers-Cebu.

Karapatan-Central Visayas said that the incident has been reported to authorities and concerned government agencies.

“We are demanding the urgent action and cooperation of state forces in our collective efforts to identify the whereabouts of Dyan and Armand. We assert that there is nothing wrong with their work and the advocacies they carry with them, and that citizens who decisively tread the path that they have should not be harassed, threatened, silenced, or arrested,” the organization wrote.

240,Thailand,Thailand: two pro-democracy defenders detained again after their bail is revoked,15/01/2023,"The Observatory has been informed about the arbitrary detention and ongoing judicial harassment of Mr Sopon Surariddhidhamrong, aka Get, leader of the student pro-democracy group Mok Luang Rim Nam, and Ms Natthanit Duangmusit, aka Baipor, member of the pro-democracy and monarchy reform activist group Thalu Wang. Founded in August 2020, Mok Luang Rim Nam has expanded from advocating for the rights of students at Navamindradhiraj University in Bangkok to various human rights issues in Thailand, including enforced disappearance, labour rights, and equality. Formed in early 2022, Thalu Wang has been advocating for the abolition of Article 112 of Thailand Criminal Code (“lèse-majesté”) and conducting public opinion polls at various locations in Bangkok on how the Thai monarchy affects people’s lives and whether the institution should be reformed.

On January 9, 2023, the Bangkok Criminal Court revoked Sopon and Natthanit’s bail and ordered their detention, on the ground that the two violated the bail conditions of their temporary release, granted on May 31, 2022, and August 4, 2022, respectively, by participating in an anti-government protest on November 17, 2022, during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Bangkok. Sopon’s bail conditions stemmed from a “lèse-majesté” case in which he is being prosecuted for allegedly giving a speech critical of Thailand’s Queen on April 22, 2022. As for Natthanit, her bail conditions also stemmed from a “lèse-majesté” case in connection with a Facebook post she shared on March 30, 2022, concerning the budget allocated to the monarchy as well as to public opinion polls she conducted in Bangkok. These surveys questioned the appropriateness of the government allegedly allowing Thailand’s King to exercise his powers at his discretion.

On the same day of their bail revocation, Sopon and Natthanit’s lawyer submitted a bail request, which was rejected by the Court, arguing that both had already broken their previous bail conditions by participating in the November 17, 2022 protest and were likely to cause other danger or commit again acts similar to the ones of which they were accused. Upon the Court’s decision, Sopon was taken to the Bangkok Remand Prison, and Natthanit was taken to the Women’s Correctional Institution in Bangkok to be held in pre-trial detention.

The first bail revocation hearing on December 15, 2022, was initiated by a court staff who submitted a report to a judge alleging that Natthanit may have violated her bail conditions by participating in the protest. Sopon was later added to the bail revocation hearing.

The Observatory recalls that Sopon and Natthanit face charges for alleged violations of Article 112 in connection with their pro-democracy and human rights activities. Sopon is currently facing “lèse-majesté” charges stemming from three separate cases: 1) a speech he made in Bangkok on April 6, 2022, which was deemed critical of the King; 2) the above-referenced speech he made at a protest in Bangkok on April 22, 2022; and 3) a speech he made on the occasion of International Workers’ Day on May 1, 2022, in Bangkok, which was deemed critical of the King. Sopon was detained for 30 days from May 2 to May 31, 2022, at the Bangkok Remand Prison, before being released on bail.

Natthanit, in turn, is currently facing charges under Article 112 in connection with three cases: 1) conducting a public opinion poll about royal motorcades at Siam Paragon in central Bangkok on February 8, 2022; 2) the above-referenced case related to the sharing of a post on Facebook about the budget allocated to the Thai monarchy on March 30, 2022; and 3) conducting public opinion polls on April 18, 2022, at different locations in Bangkok questioning the appropriateness of the government allegedly allowing the King to exercise his powers at his discretion. Natthanit was detained in connection with the February 8 event for 94 days between May 3 and August 4, 2022, at the Central Women’s Correctional Institution in Bangkok, before being released on bail.

While in detention, Sopon and Natthanit went on a hunger strike to protest their pre-trial detention and to demand their right to bail. They were granted temporary release on the conditions that they would refrain from repeating their offences, participating in demonstrations that cause public disorder, and engaging in activities that may damage the monarchy.

The Observatory expresses its deepest concern about the arbitrary detention and judicial harassment of Sopon and Natthanit, who seem to be only targeted for the legitimate exercise of their rights to freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly. Furthermore, Tantawan Tuatulanon - a human rights defender who is currently being prosecuted for delivering a speech allegedly critical of the King via Facebook live on March 5, 2022 - is scheduled to attend a bail revocation hearing on March 1, 2023, where the Court will consider whether her participation in the November 17, 2022, APEC protest violated any of her bail conditions.

The Observatory notes that between November 24, 2020, and January 11, 2023, 226 people, including many human rights defenders and 17 minors, were charged under Article 112 of the Criminal Code. Five of them are currently held in detention pending trial.

The Observatory calls on the Thai authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Sopon Surariddhidhamrong, Natthanit Duangmusit, and all other human rights defenders in the country, and to put an end to all acts of harassment, including at the judicial level, against them.",Freedom of assembly

241,Cambodia,"Cambodia: NGO asked to take down video, threatened with legal action",15/01/2023,"A right group’s head has been questioned by cybercrime police over the NGO’s involvement in releasing a rap video commemorating the ninth anniversary of bloody clashes between security personnel and garment workers.

Am Sam Ath, operations director at Licadho, was questioned by the cybercrime unit of the Phnom Penh Municipal Police on Monday. Sam Ath said he was asked where the NGO got the images and videos for the music video, and that police officials asked the NGO to take down the video.

He said the video was not meant to incite and that the NGO does not want violence like what was seen in 2014 to be repeated.

“We don’t support violent events. That is why we ask for it to be prevented from happening anymore, meaning we don’t support violence no matter which party does it,” he said.

Sam Ath added that only Licadho’s management committee as a whole could decide to take down the video.

Licadho and labor rights NGO Central released the video, sung by rapper Kea Sokun, on January 3, marking nine years since violence erupted on Phnom Penh’s Veng Sreng Boulevard, when workers were on general strike demanding an increase to the minimum wage. 

The video is titled “Workers Blood” and uses visuals of the violence, including images of workers being beaten by security personnel. The video also uses clips from media outlets like Radio Free Asia, showing military police in riot gear marching into factory and housing premises on Veng Sreng Boulevard while bleeding workers are carried away by their peers.

“For the past nine years they have been left with pain and sorrow and sadness by gestures full of blood,” Sokun says in the song.

“There is no information and they do not know where they have drifted away. There is no one who knows, and they have been waiting for justice for the past nine years, waiting so long but there is no one held responsible.”

At least four civilians were killed, another 38 were injured, and one 15-year-old boy went missing and is believed to be dead.

Sokun previously was arrested and convicted in 2020 for another rap song with nationalist lyrics like “stand up,” “I’m opposed to the dictator,” and “the other race is encroaching.”

Apart from Sam Ath, VOD has seen summon letters for three other civil society leaders: Moeun Tola, who heads Central; Vorn Pov, president of informal worker association IDEA; and Theng Savoeun, leader of the Coalition of Cambodian Farmer Community.

Tola and Pov are summoned on Tuesday, and Savoeun is scheduled to be questioned on Wednesday.

Tola said he would present himself on Tuesday but was unsure what questions the police would have for him.

“It is remembering nine years since the violence happened. … I will wait and see what the police want to know about it,” he said in brief comments.

San Sokseyha, a Phnom Penh Municipal Police spokesperson, said the Culture Ministry had asked the police to look into the video because of its incendiary lyrics. He confirmed four people had been summoned.

“We just summoned, questioned and advised him about this issue to avoid [problems] as stated by the ministry that [the video] can provoke and incite, which could affect security and public order,” he said.

Last week, the Culture Ministry asked the National Police to restrict access to the video.",Internet freedom

245,Cambodia,Cambodia: environmental monk threatened,15/01/2023,"Kampong Speu residents accused soldiers of threatening to use violence against a monk trying to protect the community’s Metta forest, confiscating his phone to stop him from taking photos of their activities.

Teok Mao, a member of the Metta forest community in Oral district, said soldiers threatened violence against the monk, who lives in the forest and was taking photos of soldiers plowing land that was previously part of the forest.

The soldiers grabbed the monk’s phone during the incident on Friday to stop him taking photos, Mao said.

It was not the first violent incident in the forest dispute, he pointed out, referring to previous gunshots amid confrontations between community members and soldiers.

“We have to keep all of this evidence and not allow them to go further,” he said. “They destroyed the forest and destroyed all the evidence.”

In 2021, a government sub-decree granted 262 hectares of forest land to the military’s armored vehicle military unit. The land is part of the Phnom Oral Wildlife Sanctuary and has traditionally been used by about 253 families, according to rights group Licadho.

Another community member, Khorn Sarith, said the soldiers had been active in the cleared parts of the forest, dredging for sand and digging boundaries.

“They plow and place marker poles. When community members stop them, they leave, but when we return home, they come to do it again. They do this almost every day.”

Pen Sarin, who villagers said was the soldier leading the clearing of Metta forest, denied any threats and said soldiers were only clearing the land the government had given them.",Right to healthy and safe environment

Since late last year, the Solidarity Against Disability Discrimination (SADD) has staged subway-riding protests at major stations in central Seoul on and off, demanding an increased government budget to protect the rights of people with disabilities, including mobility rights.

Wheelchair-bound activists have repeatedly boarded and disembarked trains to cause delays in metro services during the morning rush hour, drawing complaints from commuters.

In their latest protest on Tuesday, about 20 SADD members boarded a subway train on Line 4 at Sungshin Women's University Station at around 8 a.m. and got off at Dongdaemun History Culture Park Station.Immediately after disembarking, the activists tried to get back on the same train, but Seoul Metro workers blocked their entry, sparking protests from the activists.

""Let us get on the subway. Disabled people are citizens as well,"" they chanted.

247,Viet Nam,Vietnam: social media activist arrested on unknown charges,14/01/2023,"Vietnamese authorities arrested an activist on Tuesday on unknown charges after he posted two short messages on his Facebook page that appeared to criticize his former employer, a water purification company.

The first post on Hoang Van Vuong’s page said, “Whoever has party membership should establish clean water companies to sell dirty water but receive payments for clean water. Easy earn!” 

The second post said, “Clean water companies provide dirty water. Who is held responsible?”

Vietnam has come down hard in recent years on activists and individuals who make critical comments on Facebook, which is widely used in the Southeast Asian nation, arresting them on vague charges of “abusing the rights of freedom and democracy” or “spreading anti-state propaganda.”

Last year, authorities convicted and imprisoned at least 31 such people, handing out prison terms ranging from one to eight years.

Vuong’s younger brother, Hoang Van Quoc, told Radio Free Asia that on Tuesday, Vuong received a call from his former employer asking him to come to the office to pick up a New Year’s gift. Police at the scene then arrested him. 

Then the police went with him to his house, asked that the electricity be cut off and read out a house search warrant. They confiscated a camera, a cell phone and a broken laptop. said Hoang Van Long, his older brother.

After that, they made a record of the house search, made six copies, and had Vuong sign one before taking him away, Long said. The police didn’t tell the family what he was arrested for. 

Tuyen said he was surprised by the arrest because Vuong was not an influential political dissident and he did not post messages often on Facebook.

Vuong, 44, began voicing critical viewpoints in 2011 and as a result was detained and beaten by authorities that year and in 2012, Tuyen said.  

“He is an ordinary person and does not belong to any organization,” Tuyen said. “He spoke up whenever he saw injustice. He only talked about what he witnessed. He sometimes took part in a demonstration together with me or other groups.” 

Thong Nhat district police told RFA that they did not have the authority to respond to inquiries about the arrest and suggested contacting Dong Nai provincial police. But someone there said provincial police had not conducted the arrest, and referred RFA back to district authorities. 

Facebooker Hoang Van Vuong, 44, was arrested in Dong Nai Province for allegedly criticizing the water authorities. A relatively unknown but outspoken critic of injustice, Vuong began voicing his opinions in 2011 and was detained briefly in 2012.

250,Philippines,Philippines: artist receives death threats,17/01/2023,"Groups of artists condemned the death threat on multi-awarded artist Bonifacio Ilagan, saying the incident is yet another desperate ploy against activists and progressive cultural workers.

The Concerned Artists of the Philippines (CAP) and the Kilometer 64 Writers’ Collective (KM 54) said the threat against Ilagan is part of ongoing fascist attacks against political dissenters.

Ilagan reported to colleagues he was at a pet store in Quezon City in the afternoon of January 2 when he received a call from an unknown number.

He recalled that the caller introduced himself as a commander of a unit tasked to wipe out suspected Communists like the veteran activist.

Ilagan added that the caller warned him to desist from his activities as their so-called unit is just waiting for the “final order from the higher ups.”

“[The caller] said they would surely get me, and that I should not ask for mercy. It would be futile, because I had already been warned,” Ilagan reported.

“While the man didn’t say outright that they would kill me, his point was all too clear: They could,” Ilagan added.

The artist said that while he received his share of messages that cursed and threatened him in the past because of his activism, Monday’s incident was the first time that he received a call that said much more.

“There is no other reason I can think of behind the threat but my activism that goes way back to the 70s,” Ilagan said.

Quick condemnation

CAP said in a statement Wednesday that it condemns that crackdown against activist artists like Ilagan.

KM 64 added that the threat against Ilagan is part of an old strategy against critics of anti-people government policies.

Human rights group Karapatan earlier reported that that at least 17 civilians became victims of mass surveillance and extrajudicial killings from July 1 to November 30 of 2022.

“We are in solidarity and we stand with Bonifacio Ilagan and all other cultural workers who are part of the people’s history by fighting for truth, genuine freedom and human rights,” KM 64 said.

Who is Boni Ilagan?

Ilagan was a student activist during the Ferdinand Marcos Sr. dictatorship who led the historic Diliman Commune uprising at the University of the Philippines in 1970.

Ilagan was abducted in 1974 and was subjected to various forms of torture. After being conditionally released on 1976, Ilagan continued his activism and became a multi-awarded stage and film playwright.

He was again arrested in the 1990s but was released after three months in detention.

He was among the thousands of petitioners who filed a class action suit against the Marcos estate that awarded millions of dollars as indemnification to thousands of Martila Law victims.

He is a member of SELDA (Semahan ng mga Ex-Detainees Laban sa Detensiyon at Aresto) and co-convened the Campaign Against the Return of the Marcoses and Martial Law (CARMMA), an organization composed of martial law survivors that seek accountability for the various rights violations of the late dictator, his cronies, and the Marcos dynasty.

Ilagan was named the winner of the prestigious Gawad Plaridel in 2019, given by the College of Mass Communication of his alma mater University of the Philippines.",Right to healthy and safe environment
251,China,China: blogger reporting human rights sentenced,15/01/2023,"Reporters Without Borders (RSF) urges for the release of Chinese political commentator Ou Biaofeng, already detained for two years and who was sentenced on 30 December 2022 to three years and six months in prison for “subversion”.

“As a political commentator, Ou Biaofeng published fact-based essays that allowed the Chinese public to access information on regime's human rights abuses despite heavy censorship. Regime should release him as well as all other press freedom defenders detained in China.

On 30 December 2022, after two years in detention, Chinese political commentator and blogger Ou Biaofeng, 42, was sentenced by a court in the city of Zhuzhou City in Hunan Province (southern China) to three years and six months for “inciting subversion of state power”. Ou was also deprived of his political rights for three years and had 70,000 renminbi (almost 10,000 euros) confiscated, on the pretext that they were an “illegal income” earned from a series of articles critical of the Chinese government published in Apple Daily, Ming Pao and on the website of the civil society organisation Human Rights Campaign in China. 

On 3 December 2020, Ou was placed in administrative detention for 15 days for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” and was two weeks later transferred to one of China’s “black prisons,” under the regime of “Residential Surveillance at a Designated Location” (RSDL) in which detainees are deprived of legal representation and unable to communicate with the outside world. On 22 July 2021, Ou was then formally arrested on the charge of “inciting subversion of state power” and moved to the No. 1 Zhuzhou Municipal Detention Center.

Since Chinese leader Xi Jinping took power in 2012, he began a crusade against journalism as shown in RSF’s report The Great Leap Backwards of Journalism in China, which details Beijing’s efforts to control information and media within and outside its borders.

China ranks 175th out of 180 in the 2022 RSF World Press Freedom Index and is the world's largest captor of journalists with at least 111 detained.

Separately, on January 4, junta authorities released at least six jailed journalists as part of a wider amnesty of over 7,000 prisoners to mark the nation’s Independence Day, according to news reports, a database compiled by the local rights group Assistance Association of Political Prisoners (AAPP), and a separate database compiled by the Detained Journalists Information Myanmar private Facebook group, which was shared with CPJ via email. 

Myanmar ranked as the world’s third worst jailer of journalists, with 42 behind bars when CPJ conducted its annual prison census on December 1, 2022.

“Myanmar’s cruel carousel of jailing, sentencing, and granting early release to journalists is a form of psychological warfare aimed at breaking the will of independent journalists and media outlets,” said Shawn Crispin, CPJ’s senior Southeast Asia representative. “Authorities must immediately cease treating members of the press as criminals and should release all reporters held in custody for their work.”

254,Myanmar,Myanmar: youth surviving a raid sentenced,15/01/2023,"Three youths who survived a three-storey fall to the ground while trying to escape a military raid in Yangon’s Botahtaung Township last year were given 12-year prison sentences on Tuesday, according to a court source.

Ye Min Oo, Min Thitsar Aung, and Wai Yan Htet were among 10 people sentenced in connection with the raid at a hearing held inside Insein Prison, the source said.

All 10 were facing charges under the Explosive Substances Act, including illegal possession of explosives and endangering public safety. The sentences ranged from five to 12 years.

On August 10 of last year, regime forces stormed an apartment on 44th Street in Botahtaung, where they arrested three of the defendants—Thiha Kaung Sett, Poe Kyawt Kyawt Khant, and Wai Phyo Aung.

Ye Min Oo, Min Thitsar Aung, and Wai Yan Htet were caught after falling from the roof of the building as they attempted to flee, while two others—Wai Wai Myint and Wai Zaw Phyoe—plunged to their deaths.

The others sentenced on Tuesday were Kyaw Kyaw Oo, a taxi driver who was arrested before the raid; Kaung Sett and Min Hein Khant, who were apprehended later; and Sai Win Lwin Htut, whose details were not available at the time of reporting.

According to the father of Ye Min Oo, families were not allowed to meet with the prisoners until after they received their sentences.

“I’m in no position to say anything about the other kids, but Ye Min Oo is a very adaptable person. He can survive essentially anywhere,” he said, noting that his son—who was transferred to an interrogation centre soon after his release from the hospital—had still not fully recovered from his injuries.

“He only told us to give him some support from the background so that he could live comfortably in prison. He’s in good health save for a limp in his left leg, which I think is going to be a lifelong disability,” he added.

Poe Kyawt Kyawt Khant, the only woman among the 10 detainees, was handed a five-year sentence for possession of explosives, according to Myanmar Now’s source.

She was pregnant at the time of her arrest and reportedly gave birth inside Insein Prison in late February, the source added.

Kyaw Kyaw Oo, Kaung Sett, and Min Hein Khant each received 12-year sentences after they were found guilty of illegal possession of explosives and being accessories to offences under the Explosive Substances Act.

Kaung Sett and Min Hein Khant, who were arrested in November of last year, were also accused of being members of an urban guerrilla group and are facing additional charges, according to the court source, who was unable to provide further details.

Kaung Min Thant, the only person to escape the raid on the 44th  Street apartment, told Myanmar Now that he managed to get away by hiding on the roof of the building for 12 hours before fleeing to a safe area.

Another student who witnessed the incident said that he rode his motorcycle out to the intersection at around 14.00 to run an errand and discovered that the road was closed. He was not aware of the pending motorcade. Two of his friends, whose motorcycles were parked in front of him, flashed three-finger salutes for a moment.  Once the traffic was allowed to resume, a police officer pulled them over. The witness thought that they were going to be fined for not wearing a helmet but later learned that they had been detained for their salute.

257,Myanmar,Myanmar: media worker sentenced after secret trial,15/01/2023,"In the space of a week, Myanmar’s military have arrested a banned news agency’s editor and passed prison sentences on three other journalists, including Han Thar Nyein, a nominee for this year’s Reporters Without Borders (RSF) Press freedom Prize. RSF calls on the UN to toughen international sanctions on Myanmar’s generals to deter them from resorting to ever more terror.

    “The endless arrests and continued detention of journalists by Myanmar’s military authorities is sickening,” said Daniel Bastard, the head of RSF’s Asia-Pacific desk. “The world cannot watch the country succumb to the terror being used by the junta to control the news media. We call on Tom Andrews, the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, to take action to toughen the international sanctions targeting its generals.”

Nominated in November for RSF’s Prize for Courage, Han Thar Nyein was tried in the utmost secrecy yesterday, 26 December, by a court inside Insein prison in the Yangon suburbs and was sentenced to five years in prison for allegedly violating Section 33 (A) of Myanmar’s Electronic Transactions Law, which penalises acts detrimental to the security of the state. The details of his trial were leaked to social media the same day and were verified by RSF.

Han Thar Nyein was already sentenced in March to two years in prison with hard labour under Section 505 (a) of Myanmar’s penal code, which penalises spreading “false news” and is widely used to persecute journalists.

258,China,China: Hong Kongese media worker sentenced to 15-month jail,15/01/2023,"Reporters Without Borders (RSF) urges for the release of Hong Kong journalist Tang Cheuk-yu, who was sentenced on 22 December 2022 to 15 months for possession of alleged “offensive weapons” while covering news for Taiwan’s Public Television Service.

On 22 December 2022, freelance journalist Tang Cheuk-yu, was sentenced to 15 months for “possession of offensive weapons in a public place,” during one of Hong Kong protests. Tang was first arrested on 18 November 2019 for “unauthorised assembly” and carrying a multipurpose knife and a laser pen while filming the siege of Hong Kong Polytechnic University for Taiwan’s Public Television Service (PTS). The court acknowledged that Tang worked as a journalist at the time of the arrest.

    “Carrying tools like a multipurpose knife isn’t unusual for reporters while in the field, and sentencing a journalist for possession of so-called ‘offensive weapons’ is clearly an attempt to punish him for doing his work,” says RSF East Asia bureau head, Cédric Alviani, who urges the Hong Kong government to “release Tang Cheuk-yu alongside all other journalists and press freedom defenders detained in the territory.”

Over the past two years, the Hong Kong government has been leading an unprecedented campaign against press freedom which included the prosecution of at least 23 journalists and press freedom defenders, 11 of whom are currently detained, and the forced shutdown of major independent media outlets including Apple Daily, while the climate of fear led at least five smaller media outlets to cease operations.

Hong Kong, once a bastion of press freedom, has plummeted from 80th place in 2021 to 148th place in the 2022 RSF World Press Freedom Index, marking the index’s sharpest drop of the year. China itself ranks 175th of the 180 countries and territories evaluated.

The Protestant church is not one of the country’s approved religions and does not belong to the State-linked Vietnam Fatherland Front.

According to the Montagnard Stand for Justice Facebook page, early on Sunday morning, Y An Hdrue, 52, and fellow worshiper Y Pok Eban, 37, traveled to Cuor Knia 2 village in Buon Don district’s Ea Bar commune to attend a Christmas service at the invitation of the church.

The traffic police stopped them when they arrived, demanding to see their vehicle documents and driver's licenses.

Y An Hdrue is a former prisoner of conscience who served four years in prison for demanding religious freedom and fighting land grabs.

“Going to the gas station near Cuor Knia village, the traffic police and security forces stopped our motorbike and asked to check our papers,” he told RFA. “After checking our papers, they said they were fake.""

Even though Y An Hdrue told them he had passed his driving test and been given a license by the police the two men were forced to go to Ea Bar commune’s police headquarters.

“They forced us into the commune. We were held from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. before we were allowed to go home,” he said.

During the 10 hours, a group of five to six plainclothes policemen took turns questioning the two men, Y An Hdrue said. The officers refused to give their names, positions and places of work.

The police confiscated the men’s phones and searched through the files on them. Y An Hdrue told RFA his phone contained the International Human Rights Law and Vietnam's Law on Religion and Belief as well as some documents reporting human rights violations in Vietnam that he had collected and sent to foreign human rights groups.

Before they were released the two were forced to sign confessions.

Y An Hdrue admitted to storing information about human rights violations in Vietnam on his phone. The police then returned their papers and ordered them to drive home, keeping their phones.

Speaking from the U.S., Pastor Aga of the Central Highlands Evangelical Church of Christ told RFA followers in Dak Lak province had planned to celebrate Christmas at the house of Ea Bar commune vice president Y Kreek Bya.

He said members of the congregation told him the police warned them not to attend the service.

“The Provincial Police called to threaten them, saying that if they left their homes to go to Cuor Knia village where Y Kreek Bya was, they would be sent to prison, making them very scared and confused,” he said. “Some people still went and some had their phones and motorbikes confiscated.”

Pastor Aga said some followers hung a celebratory banner written in the Ede language at Y Kreek’s house but local authorities sent someone to take it down.

Even after harassment by the police and local authorities, he said many believers from Ea Bar commune still attended the Christmas service.

RFA called the police in Buon Don district and Dak Lak province several times to try to verify the information, but no one answered the phone.

The Vietnamese government has repeatedly accused the Central Highlands Evangelical Church of Christ of being reactionary and anti-State.

In January the People's Public Security newspaper published an article on its website accusing the religion of gathering dignitaries and ethnic minority followers in the Central Highlands and the U.S. ""to establish their own religion and ethnic minority state in the Central Highlands,"" a claim the Evangelical Church has denied.

260,Bangladesh,"Bangladesh: media worker abducted, beaten",15/01/2023,"On December 25, in the Rangunia region of the southeastern Chittagong division, a group of six to seven men confronted Azad, a reporter covering the environment and politics for the privately owned newspaper The Business Standard, while he was photographing brick kilns that were allegedly operating illegally, according to multiple news reports and the journalist, who spoke with CPJ by phone.

Azad identified himself as a journalist, and the men then forced him into a vehicle at gunpoint, and they threatened to kill him; they then beat him and brought him to a local government official’s office, where they assaulted him further and robbed him, he told CPJ, saying he was released after about 90 minutes.

Azad suffered a neck fracture and pain in his chest, abdomen, and hands, according to the journalist and medical documents that CPJ reviewed.

“The abduction and gruesome beating of Abu Azad demonstrate the grave dangers facing journalists who cover environmental issues in Bangladesh,” said Beh Lih Yi, CPJ’s Asia program coordinator. “Authorities must swiftly and thoroughly investigate this incident and hold the perpetrators accountable. Bangladesh must put an end to its dreadful record of impunity involving attacks on journalists.”

Azad told CPJ that one of the attackers was Mohiuddin Talukder Mohan, a member of the Islampur Union Parishad government unit, and said he was brought to Mohan’s office, where three additional men joined the others. The men deactivated the office’s security cameras, beat him with their hands and pistols, kicked him repeatedly, and confiscated his mobile phone, wallet, and identification card, Azad told CPJ.

At the office, Mohan called Sirajul Islam Chowdhury, chair of the Islampur Union Parishad, who threatened the journalist, saying, “nothing will happen if a journalist like you was killed,” and then ordered the men to beat Azad further and destroy his phone, Azad told CPJ.

The men withdrew all the money from Azad’s mobile banking app, bKash, and stole 10,000 taka (US$97) in cash that he carried with him, the journalist told CPJ, adding that they demanded an additional 50,000 taka (US$486) as ransom, which he did not provide.

While releasing him, one of the men hit Azad on the neck with a steel rod, the journalist told CPJ. As of Wednesday, January 4, Azad had not received his phone, wallet, money, or identification card, he said.

CPJ contacted Mohan via messaging app for comment but did not receive any reply. CPJ texted Chowdhury for comment but did not receive any response.

On December 26, Azad filed a police complaint against 10 people, including Mohan and Chowdhury, for assault, extortion, kidnapping, and attempted murder, according to the journalist and The Business Standard.

Police arrested one suspect that day, identified as the manager of a brick kiln, who appeared in court on Wednesday, January 4, and was ordered to be transferred to jail, the journalist and The Business Standard said. On Tuesday, January 3, the Bangladesh High Court granted anticipatory bail to Mohan and Chowdhury, protecting them from arrest for four weeks, Azad said, adding that the other suspects have not been apprehended.

CPJ sent a request for comment via messaging app to Md Mahbub Milky, officer-in-charge at the Rangunia Model Police Station, where Azad filed his complaint, but did not receive any response.

Mohan and Chowdhury are both members of the ruling Awami League party and both have business and political interests in the kilns, Azad told CPJ.

274,Myanmar,Myanmar: more media workers sentenced,15/01/2023,"In December, Myanmar courts sentenced at least eight independent journalists to prison terms ranging from three to 10 years, according to news reports and journalists who spoke to CPJ.

Separately, on January 4, junta authorities released at least six jailed journalists as part of a wider amnesty of over 7,000 prisoners to mark the nation’s Independence Day, according to news reports, a database compiled by the local rights group Assistance Association of Political Prisoners (AAPP), and a separate database compiled by the Detained Journalists Information Myanmar private Facebook group, which was shared with CPJ via email. 

Myanmar ranked as the world’s third worst jailer of journalists, with 42 behind bars when CPJ conducted its annual prison census on December 1, 2022.

“Myanmar’s cruel carousel of jailing, sentencing, and granting early release to journalists is a form of psychological warfare aimed at breaking the will of independent journalists and media outlets,” said Shawn Crispin, CPJ’s senior Southeast Asia representative. “Authorities must immediately cease treating members of the press as criminals and should release all reporters held in custody for their work.”

On December 16, a special court in Yangon’s Insein Prison sentenced Wai Lynn, founder of the local outlet Tingangyun Post, and Ma Htet Htet, an editor at the outlet, to five years each in prison under Section 5 of the Explosives Substances Act, which penalizes the unlawful possession of explosive substances, according to news reports and an AAPP statement.

Both reporters had been charged under Article 505(a), a broad provision that criminalizes incitement and the dissemination of false news, and under the Counter Terrorism Law before their convictions under the separate provision.

On either December 16 or 17, freelance journalist Soe Yarzar Tun was sentenced to four years in prison with hard labor under Section 52(a) of the Counter Terrorism Law, according to a report by The Irrawaddy and a statement by the AAPP.

The action, which was carried out by hundreds of masses from a combination of students from all over West Java, was dispersed by the police.

The action this time was the form of the umpteenth time rejecting the Criminal Code which was later passed by the DPR and the government some time ago. The masses carried the theme of the action ""West Java Sues, Bandung Seas Anger"".

One of the participants in the action, Audi, said that initially the action went smoothly. The students demanded that the Criminal Code, which contains problematic articles, be repealed immediately. They gave speeches voicing their demands in front of the West Java DPRD Building until 18.00 WIB.

The demonstrators had asked to have an audience with members of the West Java DPRD, but several people's representatives only stood at the door, not meeting the demonstrators.

After the sunset call to prayer, conditions began to become unfavorable. Allegedly there was a provocation that made the action heated up.

""And finally, right after the call to prayer, we started to break up,"" said Audi, to Bandungmoving.id when met at the Bandung Polrestabes, Thursday night.

In the midst of a chaotic situation, the masses asked members of the West Java DPRD to leave. But then the first water cannon shots started at around 19.30 WIB. This causes the masses to scatter.

After having retreated for a while, the masses returned to the fence area of the West Java DPRD Building. It was then that the students said they started receiving tear gas shots. The crowd scattered, some of them fainted.

Police armed with batons then chased and dispersed the demonstrators. As a result, a number of students were injured, several people were rushed to the hospital.

""We are advancing again, the tear gas was shot behind the (first) DPRD fence, only then the second tear gas was shot out. There the masses started to get upset, there started a lot of victims from students in West Java,"" said Audi.

Audi itself became one of the victims. The student from a private university in Bandung admitted that he was hit with a bat and was knocked unconscious. Two of his friends were even caught and taken to the Bandung Polrestabes.

Not only that, several other campus students also became victims of repression. Among others, from UIN Bandung. Preliminary data from the students noted that 17 people were arrested and taken to the Bandung Polrestabes. This data is still being updated.

Head of BEM Unpad, Virdian Aurellio regretted the repressive actions of the police in securing the action. He recorded how many students were examined and their devices were detained to be taken to the Bandung Polrestabes.

""We didn't do anything to point fingers, where here, we checked our wallets, checked our cellphones, then our friends were told to squat like criminals,"" he said.

On the other hand, a number of public defender activists from the Bandung Legal Aid Institute (LBH), the Indonesian Legal Aid Association (PBHI), and LBH Berani experienced difficulty accessing them when they tried to provide legal assistance to students who were arrested at the Bandung Polrestabes. New legal assistance can be given at 22.25 WIB.

277,India,India: community assaulted for protesting military camp,14/01/2023,"About the Human Rights Defenders:
• Villagers of Gangaloor block in Chhattisgarh who are protesting the establishment of illegal paramilitary camps in Pusnar and Burji villages.
• Moolwasi Bachao Manch is a civil society platform steered by educated youth that works towards protecting the constitutional, legal and cultural rights of socially marginalised groups. The Moolwasi Bachao Manch also spearheads similar ongoing peaceful protests against paramilitary camps proposed/set up without gram sabha consent in several other places in south Bastar area of Chhattisgarh
such as Silger, Nahadi and Dharmaram.

Background of the Incident:
Villagers in Gangaloor block in the Maoist-insurgency affected Bijapur district of Chhattisgarh have been opposing the establishment of new paramilitary camp in Burji
village without due process.
In end-2021, villagers – predominantly tribals – began a peaceful sit-in protest at Burji
village, located 3 km away from Gangaloor police station, demanding the withdrawal of all proposed security camps in the block.
The dharna was organised under the banner of Moolwasi Bachao Manch, and a stage and temporary shelters were constructed at the venue to facilitate the indefinite protest.
Hundreds of villagers including men, women and children from Gangaloor and adjacent blocks took turns to visit the dharna site every day for over a year to participate in the protest.
The protestors alleged that proposed paramilitary camps in Burji and Pusnar villages were in violation of provisions in the Forest Rights Act, 2006 and the Panchayat (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, as they did not have consent from gram sabhas.

They demanded withdrawal of proposed paramilitary camps, and protested against the construction of a concrete road through the farm lands of hundreds of families in
Gangaloor, Pusnar, Hiroli and other villages. They also demanded justice for the victims of police firing in Silger village (May 2021) and other encounters in Bastar.
Activists from Moolwasi Bachao Manch also met and/or wrote to various government authorities in 2021 and 2022 demanding withdrawal of proposed paramilitary camps.
Details of the Incident:
Shortly after midnight on December 15, 2022, a large contingent of police and paramilitary personnel led by Mr. Anjaneya Varshney, Superintendent of Police Bijapur;
Mr. Ashok Patel, Divisional Forest Officer; Mr. Pavan Verma, Officer in Charge, Gangaloor Police station; and Officer in Charge, Bijapur Kotwali Police station arrived at the protest spot in Burji in official vehicles.
The police used brute force to break up the peaceful assembly of about 200 protestors.
They bulldozed the stage and temporary shelters set up by protestors and destroyed or threw away their belongings such as rice, dal, vegetables, utensils, and clothes. When villagers and activists from Moolwasi Bachao Manch protested against the
vandalism, police began a lathi-charge. They charged at protestors, many of whom were still asleep, and hit them with batons, forcing them to flee from the dharna site. The police force then moved to Pusnar.
At 10 AM on December 15, 2022, when the protestors started trickling back to the protest site, they chased away villagers who, hitting them with batons. Meanwhile, other police and paramilitary personnel proceeded to Pusnar village, located 7-8 km away through dense forests, where they set up a security camp within a few hours.
More than 25 protestors suffered serious injuries on their head, back, hands and legs due to the assault by police. Though many of them were unable to walk or stand upright for over a week, they did not visit the government hospital or access medical treatment fearing intimidation and arrest by police.
Since the construction of the camp in Pusnar, police and paramilitary personnel stationed there have not allowed villagers to harvest their crops in farmlands in the vicinity of the camp. Police also beat and chase away villagers when they venture into the forest to fetch firewood and other forest produce.
Tribal villagers and Moolwasi Bachao Manch activists who were part of the dharna in Burji had been highlighting violation of their constitutional and legal rights through peaceful means for over one year. While the government paid little heed to their concerns, a security camp was established in Pusnar overnight on December 15, 2022.

289,Pakistan,Pakistan: media worker threatened for covering corruption case,15/01/2023,"Reporters Without Borders (RSF) condemns a Pakistani businessman’s “unacceptable” threats against a newspaper editor in response to a story implicating him in a prominent corruption scandal, and calls on Pakistan’s government to guarantee the journalist’s safety.

The threats were made in a phone call that Hamza Azhar Salam - the editor of The Pakistan Daily newspaper - received on 9 December, the day after he ran a story implying that, in 2019, property tycoon Malik Riaz helped then Prime Minister Imran Khan cheat the state of millions of dollars. If the story and a tweet about the story were not deleted, “routes, alternate to legal routes” would be used,” Salam was told by a man working for Riaz.

    “This type of threat is absolutely unacceptable,” said Daniel Bastard, the head of RSF’s Asia-Pacific desk. “Regardless of their power and the brutality of the methods they otherwise employ, the business community cannot use threats to block the revelation of matters that are of major interest to the citizens of Pakistan. We call on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government to do whatever is necessary to ensure that Hamza Azhar Salam is protected and to guarantee respect for the rule of law.”

The story published by Salam under his own by-line provided evidence that Farah Gogi, a close friend of then Prime Minister Imran Khan’s wife, flew to Dubai on 29 April 2019 aboard a plane owned by Bahria Town, Riaz’s construction company.

Corruption scandal

The timing of the trip is important because it coincided with the sale in Dubai of a diamond jewellery set that Khan had received from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. Khan is said to have sold the jewellery for two million dollars in violation of regulations stipulating that gifts received by government representatives from foreign leaders belong to the state. 

The alleged violation has been used by the Election Commission of Pakistan as grounds for banning Khan from running for public office for five years.

“The implication of my story” was that Bahria Town CEO Malik Riaz “actively facilitated an act of corruption by Farah Gogi that ultimately benefited then Prime Minister Imran Khan and his family,” Salam told RSF. 

Extensive influence

As well as being threatened, Salam is also being summoned by Riaz to pay 10 billion rupees (more than 40 million euros) in damages. He has tried to resist by legal means but says the property tycoon’s influence extends to many areas of Pakistani society including the judicial system.

    “Malik Riaz's family has a history of using armed goons to intimidate people,” he said. “I have been advised to change residence frequently and to limit my contact with the outside world. I’m still trying to lead a normal life, but I live in fear because of the threats from Bahria Town.”

Salam’s fears should be taken seriously as almost all of the murders of journalists in Pakistan in the past 20 years have gone unpunished. Pakistan is ranked 157th out of 180 countries in RSF's 2022 World Press Freedom Index.

304,Indonesia,Indonesia: four land rights defenders face indictment over land dispute,29/01/2023,"The Bandung Legal Aid Institute (LBH) urged the court to acquit four farmers from Cikandang and Margamulya, Cikajang District, Garut Regency. The four of them were jailed on a report from PTPN VIII accusing them of cultivating the land illegally.

LBH Bandung's legal team for Cikandang farmers M Rafi Saiful Islam said, on Wednesday (30/11/2022), the four farmers named Nandang, Saepudin, Ujang Juhana, and Pakih had undergone an indictment hearing from the Garut District Attorney. The four were charged with violating Article 170 of the Criminal Code Jo Article 55 Paragraph (1) of the Criminal Code Jo Article 107 letter c Jo Article 55 letter c Law No 39 of 2014, which carries a penalty of 5 years in prison.

""The four farmers who are members of the Badega Farmers Union have been criminalized by PTPN VIII after working on abandoned land in the Cisaroni afdeling land. Their cultivated land includes Margamulya Village and Cikandang Village,"" said Rafi in his statement, Thursday (1/12/2022).

""We urge the release of the four detained farmers. In fact, these four farmers are agrarian reform fighters who are fighting for land to be managed as a livelihood,"" he added.

Rafi said the four farmers from Cikandang, Garut, were fighting for land rights that they should have been able to get. This is because the land they are working on is no longer productive and has been neglected by PTPN VIII. However, because of the regulation on cultivation rights (HGU), farmers cannot immediately work on PTPN VIII's land. Even though the land cultivated by the farmers had been abandoned by PTPN VIII and was not productive at all.

""As is the real condition on the ground, the land area located in Cikandang Village, the area cultivated by Cipancur blocks 5 and 6, is no longer productive and has been neglected by PTPN VIII,"" he said.

According to LBH, the land abandoned by PTPN VII must be of benefit to the surrounding community. Moreover, the four of them were sharecroppers who did not have their own arable land at all. ""Most of the people in Cikandang Village are people who make a living in the agricultural sector. However, limited agricultural land causes farmers in this area to work as farm laborers, which results in their income being inadequate and far from enough to support their families. So farm workers in there are many who become cultivators of unproductive or neglected land in the PTPN VIII plantation area,"" he said.

LBH also urged PTPN VIII's HGU regulations to be repealed for farmers in Cikandang Village, Garut. They also urged the four farmers to be immediately released, and asked law enforcement officials to review their decision. ""Revoke the PTPN VIII HGU of Cikandang Village in the area cultivated by Cipancur blocks 5 and 6 which have been abandoned land and cultivated by farmers for a source of life. (And) law enforcement officials should look more at the context of land tenure where these farmers are actually getting land tenure rights is not answered through punishment,"" he said.
Chronology of Events

When confirmed again, Rafi told the chronology of the case. The case that happened to four Cikandang farmers occurred in mid-2022. They were reported by PTPN VIII to the Cikajang Police with accusations of destroying tea trees. ""From the beginning of 2022 there was actually a conflict. Until mid-March, June, July, the conflict escalated somewhat and resulted in a report from PTPN to the Cikajang Police. The report was destruction of plantation land,"" Rafi told detikJabar.

Rafi revealed that the farmers in CiSometimes Village did not feel they had damaged the land or the tea trees on PTPN VIII's land. The residents even helped to re-productive the land on the land because it had been called neglected by PTPN VIII for years. Not only that, residents, according to Rafi's narrative, also felt that since 1995 they had not found any more activity on the land which now has the status of PTPN VIII. According to him, if it has been neglected, the residents have the right to work on the land that PTPN is not using at all.

""The facts on the ground are that the land has been abandoned, the tea trees are approximately 4 meters high and filled with shrubs. Anyway, it's like a wilderness, not like tea plantations in general,"" he said.

""That's why the residents took the initiative to clear the land. But in fact it ended in a report from PTPN to the Cikajang Police. Even though nothing was damaged, because the land was abandoned land. So there is no such thing as destroying tea plantations, but the residents are working on abandoned land,"" said Rafi.

Prosecutor's Response

In response to this, the Garut State Prosecutor's Office opened their voices. The Public Prosecutor (JPU) Friza Adiyudha said that currently the case was already being tried.

""The agenda is already in court. Our detention will be made on November 14, during the second stage. We will go to court on November 20, then issue a decision from the court on November 23,"" said Friza to journalists in his office, Thursday (1/12/2022).

Based on the case file that was transferred by the Garut Police to the Attorney General's Office, investigators charged the four suspects with Article 170 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, as well as an alternative charge, namely Article 107 C of RI Law Number 39 of 2014 concerning Plantations. ""As for the threat of punishment, Article 179 is 5 years and 8 months, for more than 5 years you can be detained. The alternative to Article 107 is 4 years maximum,"" said Friza.

Friza said, based on the case files he received, the case started with the felling of a number of tea trees, which was carried out by the four defendants, namely Nandang, Saepudin, Ujang and Pakih around June 2022. ""The defendants and other perpetrators who are still on the wanted list carried out logging or clearing of PTPN VIII's tea trees. There are many trees, hundreds maybe. Because this happened in several PTPN areas,"" he said.

The defendants admitted to their actions. According to Friza, based on the testimony of the defendants, they felt they had the right to manage the land which he acknowledged as state property. ""Only, in this case, PTPN objected so PTPN finally reported it to the Police. Even during the trial, the defendants still felt that what they did was not wrong,"" said Friza.",Land rights

320,Nepal,Nepal: NGO staff harassed for monitoring election,06/02/2023,"INSEC expresses its concern on the misbehavior experienced by our team members through a group of unidentified people on November 25, 2022 during their visit to Syangja’s Constituency no. 2, Chapakot Municipality wards no. 3, 4 and 5. During the elections held on November 20 the CPN-UML, Rastriya Swatantra Party, Rastriya Prajtantra Party and others including independent candidates had demanded re-polling and the vote count had not begun yet; the team of INSEC had visited to monitor the situation.

In order to monitor the situation, the team of INSEC had gone to Janaksakriya Basic School of Chithipokhari polling station located in Chapakot Municipality-5. During this, the team discussed the events of the voting day with the local residents. After the discussion, while returning to the headquarters, a group of unidentified people made the INSEC team get off the vehicle, took pictures of the people and their vehicle, made unnecessary inquiries, and later called, abused and threatened them. Although the monitoring team introduced the purpose of the visit and the organization to the group, they were threatened to return immediately and were warned on the uncertainties in the future if they did not leave.

It is required to remember here that Nepal’s human rights defenders have continuously monitored the situation of human rights even in the difficult situation of armed conflict. The Constitution and laws of Nepal and many treaty agreements to which Nepal is a party state ensures the right of human rights defenders to monitor the human rights situation without interruption.

It is certainly not pleasant that such an incident happened to the organization that has received permission of Election observation through the Election Commission. Disruption in monitoring helps to confirm the allegations of booth capture made by opposition political parties. We request Election Commission and the Government of Nepal to bring those involved in this incident to justice and prepare an environment for uninterrupted monitoring.",Right to healthy and safe environment

""That the land is still in the process of cassation efforts and there has not even been a decision to carry out an execution,"" said Frank.

""However, the North Sulawesi Provincial Government used security forces with full firearms to force their way in and fired tear gas several times at the demonstration. In fact, one police officer was recorded as swearing at farmers,"" he continued.

Regarding this, LBH Manado together with the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation (YLBHI) conveyed their urging,

1) Stop Forced Evictions in Kalasey Dua Village, Minahasa.
2) Withdraw the Police and stop intimidating farmers, students and legal assistants.
3) Release the farmers, students and LBH Manado Public Lawyers who were arrested and taken to the Manado Police.",Freedom of assembly

TKWL on the land they manage because a few weeks earlier, PT TKWL informed residents that the heavy equipment to be operated would only function to repair roads. However, in reality, the heavy equipment entered the land and made excavations on the people's land.

For this reason, stop scaring farmers, stop all efforts to criminalize in resolving agrarian conflicts because criminal law is actually not a place for resolving agrarian conflicts,"" said Noval Setiawan, public lawyer for LBH Pekanbaru.

Apart from that, Noval also explained that the criminalization efforts carried out by PT TKWL were a denial of human rights as regulated in Article 28 G of the 1945 Constitution which reads, ""Everyone has the right to protection of himself/herself, family, honor, dignity, and property owned by under his authority, and is entitled to a sense of security and protection from threats of fear to do or not do something which is a human right.”

""This effort adds to a series of bad things that have injured the farmers' struggle with patterns of criminalization and silencing,"" said Noval.

In line with that, the Director of LBH Pekanbaru, Andi Wijaya, stated that Anton and other friends, are local people who have lived for a long time and have a livelihood that came from the transmigration program in the 90s. resolve the issue of agrarian conflicts and accelerate the process of agrarian reform for transmigration communities in Siak district.

""On January 20, 2022, Anton et al who are members of the Marhaen Ideal Farmers Association have written to the President and related ministries including the ATR/BPN ministry to grant their rights which have been mandated in the 1945 Constitution and fulfill the president's commitment to agrarian reform,"" explained Andi Wijaya.",Right to Protest
411,Cambodia,Cambodia: union leaders prevented from receiving funds from abroad,27/01/2023,"NagaWorld union members are alleging that ABA Bank blocked three transactions to their accounts from an overseas donor while giving various explanations about negative news of the union in the press or anti-money laundering measures.

The Labor Rights Supported Union of NagaWorld casino has been in dispute with the gambling corporation over the termination of 1,300 workers in 2021, out of which fewer than 200 workers are holding out for reinstatement. The protests have often taken a violent turn when district security guards and police officers use force to break up gatherings.

Three NagaWorld union members said they were expecting transfers from an overseas sender in October to support protesters without jobs or with babies, but were separately informed by a person saying they were from ABA Bank that the transfers were blocked.

Chhim Sokhorn and Klaing Soben told VOD they were expecting $5,050 each to be transferred into their ABA accounts. The two NagaWorld casino workers said they did not know where the money was coming from as union president Chhim Sithar was handling the grant application.

Sithar has been in pretrial detention since November when she was rearrested for allegedly breaking her bail conditions. Sithar, who was at a bail hearing at a Phnom Penh court last week, told VOD the grant was from the Urgent Action Fund in Australia, a feminist group in Australia that supports movements led by women and nonbinary activists.

VOD was unable to interview Sithar further in court.

Sokhorn and Soben both said they were separately contacted by an ABA staffer in October who questioned them on what they would do with the $5,050 transfers and raised the union’s ongoing dispute as the reason why the transactions had been blocked.

Sokhorn said an ABA employee named Sroy Mengty first contacted her on messaging application Telegram on October 13 and then on two other occasions on the 14th and 26th of the same month.

According to text and audio messages between the two of them on Telegram, Mengty informs Sokhorn on October 13 that the transfers will not be processed because of the “negative news about NagaWorld.” When he asks what the money will be used for, Sokhorn tells him it was to assist unemployed union members and for workers with children.

Mengty further says on the 14th: “The reason is because you don’t have proper documents for the money and have negative news about NagaWorld.”

Sokhorn continues to ask Mengty why the money was blocked, whether it was being sent back to the sender in Australia, and if her account had been frozen. He doesn’t reply until the 26th.

“It is because of the policy of the bank in case there is money laundering,” Mengty informs Sokhorn in a message on the 26th.

“From ABA, the money has been returned back. But I don’t know if an intermediary bank is involved. So it is out of our hands,” he adds, then stops replying to subsequent messages.

Sokhorn said she felt it was suspicious that the bank staffer would message her on Telegram, and not give her a single clear reason for blocking the money.

“The grant was to support protesting workers who don’t have jobs and those with babies. It was not for the protests but for those without jobs,” she said.

Soben, who was elected union treasurer last year, received similar text and voice messages from Mengty starting October 19. He asks her what the money is going to be used for, saying he needs to know before he can allow the “frozen” transaction to proceed.

“He said he needs to check if nothing bad will happen [with the money] and only then can he send it through,” Soben said in December.

Soben was first worried that her account would be frozen — a frequent conduit for small donations the union gets for supporting terminated workers. A week later, Mengty tells her that the money has been permanently blocked and sent back to the sender, but that her account is still active.

The two workers said they were unsure if the restrictions on their account were potentially because of bail conditions imposed on them following arrests related to the ongoing strike. Lawyers for Sithar have argued in court that jailed workers released on bail were not told the full conditions for their release.

VOD contacted Igor Zimarev, ABA’s chief marketing officer, and Khuon Pinoch, public relations supervisor, over the last two weeks, but they did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Emails sent to the Urgent Action Fund in Australia also went unanswered this week.

Terminated workers at the NagaWorld casino and represented by the union have said they are facing financial hardships as part of the prolonged labor action against the casino corporation.

The union’s registration has yet to be renewed by the Labor Ministry after elections last year for senior leadership because the ministry says the elected leaders, like Sithar, Sokhorn and Soben, are no longer employees of the casino. Soben said the union’s official bank account with Acleda bank had been frozen because the union’s registration was not renewed.

Separately, to raise funds for workers, Nop Tithboravy, a union member, started a $1 campaign encouraging donations to her personal Acleda bank account to support workers who were holding out against NagaWorld.

Last August, supporters of the union in Australia tried to transfer around $1,000 to her Acleda account but were unable to send the money. Tithboravy decided to ask Acleda why the transfers were blocked.

“The [senders] recommended I ask the bank and I went to ask them. But the banker said nothing was wrong with the back account. It was still running as normal,” Tithboravy said.

Unlike her colleagues, the bank staff did not ask about her union affiliation or why the money was being transferred. She was left confused because she had previously received transfers from overseas and continues to get domestic donations.

She also rued the lost opportunity to get support for workers.

“When people tried to send the money to support us again and again they couldn’t send it. So they also felt less interest to keep supporting us,” she said.

In Channy, the president of Acleda, asked the NagaWorld workers to contact bank staff because he cannot discuss these issues publicly.

“She should come to meet,” he said. “For these kinds of cases, we can’t put [the information] in public. She should come and they will explain it to her.”

ABA touts itself as one of the top three commercial banks in the country and has 2.1 million customers. The bank is also popular for the omnipresence of its branded QR codes that have become synonymous for bank transfers. ABA was also among a number of banks that last year blocked transfer attempts out of Cambodia to support the fighting in Ukraine.",Right to work

541,Malaysia,Malaysia: Pakistani media worker deported despite being UNHCR card holder,07/02/2023,"The wife of Pakistani journalist Syed Fawad Ali Shah, who was deported in August, has denied that her husband is a former police officer.

Syeda said her husband was never a policeman.

“He is a journalist. You can see many of his articles on the internet,” she told FMT.

Syeda was responding to the claim made by home minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail when confirming that Malaysia had obliged Pakistan’s request to have Fawad deported “sometime in the third week of August”.

Fawad, the minister claimed, was a former policeman with disciplinary issues back home.

Syeda questioned how the Malaysian authorities could ignore the fact that Fawad was in exile in Kuala Lumpur with a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) card when sending him back to Pakistan where he may face persecution.

She said the deportation has put Fawad’s life in danger.

“When we asked the Pakistan High Commission here, they said they were not involved. After looking for him in Pakistan and in Malaysia, I can’t find him. What do I do now?”

Syeda had come to Kuala Lumpur to look for Fawad after attempts to contact him failed. A housemate lodged a missing person’s report in August.

Fawad, who was in exile in Malaysia for more than 10 years, has been missing since Aug 23 last year.

The 41-year-old had sought asylum in Malaysia, claiming he was being persecuted in Pakistan over articles published in several English dailies there related to alleged government corruption.

When her husband didn’t call as expected one night last August, Syeda knew something was wrong.

Syed Fawad Ali Shah, a Pakistani journalist living in exile in Malaysia, never missed their daily call. But despite Syeda’s efforts to find answers, it has been five months since she's heard from her husband.

Syeda’s pleas for answers from Malaysian and Pakistani authorities have largely been met with silence. “This is mental torture,” she told VOA, asking that we use only her first name.

The last time Syeda saw her husband was in the spring of 2022, when she was able to visit him in Malaysia. The last time she heard his voice was during a phone call on August 22.

The first inkling of her husband’s fate came on January 4, when Malaysian Home Affairs Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail acknowledged at a press conference that Shah had been deported to Pakistan in August, at the request of the Pakistan High Commission in Kuala Lumpur.

Malaysia said Pakistani authorities contended that Shah was a police officer who was the subject of disciplinary proceedings.

Syeda, a business professor who lives and works in Pakistan, said her husband has never worked for the police.

But even with Malaysia saying the journalist had been deported, questions remain. The most obvious is: Where is Shah?

Pakistani officials have told Syeda her husband is not in the country. But media rights analysts believe Islamabad is holding him.

Attempts by VOA to seek comment from Pakistani and Malaysian officials and embassies were not successful.

A spokesperson for Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry told VOA’s Urdu Service in a Thursday briefing that deportations are “finalized after consultations between governments through specific channels under certain legal provisions.”

The spokesperson directed VOA’s other questions about the case to the Ministry of Information. VOA contacted the information minister via a messaging app but did not receive a response by the time of publication.

Efforts to seek comment from Pakistan’s Interior Ministry and Federal Investigation Agency were also unsuccessful.

VOA also reached out to Malaysia’s home affairs and immigration ministries, and the Pakistan High Commission, but as of publication had not received a response.

Intimidation tactics

For years, Shah reported critically on Pakistan, including the country’s powerful military and intelligence agencies.

Writing for the Pakistani daily The Nation, he produced a series of investigative stories about enforced disappearances and probable links between Taliban groups and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), a Pakistani intelligence agency.

Then in January 2011, the ISI abducted Shah and tortured him for months in a cellar, media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said.

At that time, said Daniel Bastard, head of the Asia-Pacific desk at RSF, intelligence agencies would hold reporters for months, “just to intimidate the whole community of journalists in Pakistan.”

Shortly after Shah was released, he fled to Malaysia and applied for refugee status.

Despite the distance, Pakistan’s intelligence agencies made efforts to forcibly repatriate him, even contacting Interpol on multiple occasions, according to RSF. Interpol refused.

In December 2019, a letter stamped “ISI” was sent to his Malaysian home, the news website Free Malaysia Today reported. He had one “last opportunity” to go to an agency in Kuala Lumpur to get an emergency passport, the letter said. “If you refuse to do so then we will make a horrific example of you,” it said.

Syeda shared a screenshot of an email her husband wrote to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in 2021. In it, he wrote, ""I am always afraid that I will be deported to Pakistan secretly or dramatically without informing to the UNHCR Malaysia.""

Paper trail

Analysts who spoke with VOA believe the Malaysian government likely deported Shah in error, saying the country did not have much to gain from the move.

There should be paperwork documenting Shah’s deportation, including when and how he left the country, according to Waytha Moorthy Ponnusamy, a Malaysian lawyer Syeda hired to investigate her husband’s case. But that paperwork doesn’t appear to exist, he said.

“Someone is hiding something,” Ponnusamy told VOA. “That’s the reason why we are trying to get to the bottom of it.”

Ponnusamy is among those who believe Shah was deported through an error. Still, he blames a select few Malaysian and Pakistani officials for what happened.

Syeda traveled to Malaysia in mid-December. She had wanted to travel earlier, but she was pregnant. Eventually, she said, the stress and anxiety caused by her husband’s disappearance became too much, leading to a miscarriage in October.

After arriving in Kuala Lumpur, Syeda worked with Ponnusamy to push Malaysia to reveal more information, but with no success.

Since the deportation, elections in November 2022 brought a change of power to Malaysia. Even though the officials are new, the government’s indifference is not, according to Predeep Nambiar, a journalist at Free Malaysia Today who is helping Syeda.

“The apathy — that really, frankly, pisses me off,” he told VOA. “It’s very opaque.”

In a country that ranks low on press freedom indexes, that has little freedom of information, that has not signed the 1951 Refugee Convention, and that does not respect the principle of non-refoulement, the Malaysian government’s indifference in this case is not surprising, Nambiar said.

Transnational repression

Shah’s disappearance underscores the lengths Islamabad will go to to muzzle its critics, analysts told VOA, as well as the dangers dissidents face, even when thousands of miles away.

Authoritarian governments have long blurred borders to “silence dissent,” according to Yana Gorokhovskaia, who researches transnational repression at Freedom House.

“There’s a whole universe in which governments cooperate to target people, or at least facilitate the targeting of people,” she told VOA.

Shah’s disappearance followed several other cases in which Pakistani exiles have been harassed and sometimes even killed.

It’s a pattern that Taha Siddiqui is acutely aware of. After barely escaping a 2018 kidnapping attempt in Islamabad, the reporter fled to France.

He still receives intimidating phone calls and messages from Pakistani officials, he said, and people affiliated with the embassy surveilled him, even checking up on him at the bar he runs in Paris. He said an American intelligence agency told him a few years ago that he was on a Pakistani “kill list.”

Pakistan’s Paris embassy did not respond to an email requesting comment.

Pakistani intelligence agencies have also harassed his family members, Siddiqui said. “They told my mother that Taha thinks that he’s safe in Paris, but no one is safe anywhere.”

He added that the disappearance of Shah has made him nervous for his own safety.

Since advocating for her husband in Malaysia, Syeda said she has received intimidating messages and calls telling her to return to Pakistan. Fearful that she would be disappeared, Syeda applied to extend her visa. The request was denied.

“It is very risky for me, but I have no other option,” she told VOA hours before she left the country. “My life is at risk but still I am going.”

A day after arriving in northern Pakistan, she told VOA that two men who said they were with ISI came to her home and instructed her to keep quiet.

“Don’t make your life difficult,” they told her, adding that her husband was not in Pakistan.

“I am worried,” she told VOA. “Please pray for me.”",Right to healthy and safe environment

606,Bangladesh,"Bangladesh: citizen journalist arrested, asked to pay bribe",26/01/2023,"Bangladesh’s Armed Police Battalion (APBn) is committing extortion, arbitrary arrests, and harassment of Rohingya refugees already facing violence from criminal gangs and armed groups, Human Rights Watch said today. Donor governments should press the Bangladesh authorities to investigate alleged abuses against Rohingya living in refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, ensure that victims have effective remedies, and develop measures to better protect refugees.

The Armed Police Battalion took over security in the Rohingya camps in July 2020. Refugees and humanitarian workers report that safety has deteriorated under the APBn’s oversight due to increased police abuses as well as criminal activity. Some refugees allege collusion between APBn officers and armed groups and gangs operating in the camps.

“Abuses by police in the Cox’s Bazar camps have left Rohingya refugees suffering at the hands of the very forces who are supposed to protect them,” said Shayna Bauchner, Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Bangladesh authorities should immediately investigate allegations of widespread extortion and wrongful detention by Armed Police Battalion officers and hold all those responsible to account.”

Human Rights Watch interviewed more than 40 Rohingya refugees in October and November 2022 and reviewed police reports, documenting more than 16 cases of serious abuse by APBn officers. These included abuses against 10 refugees who were detained on apparently fabricated grounds for trafficking yaba, a methamphetamine drug, or for violence-related offenses. Human Rights Watch and others have long documented the common practice by Bangladesh security forces of framing suspects with drugs or weapons.

Almost every case Human Rights Watch investigated involved extortion either directly by APBn officers or communicated through majhis, the camp community leaders. Police generally demanded 10,000-40,000 taka (US$100-400) to avoid arrest, and 50,000-100,000 taka ($500-1,000) for the release of a detained family member. Families often had to sell gold jewelry or borrow money for bribes or legal costs. Many worried about the harm to their reputation.

Several refugees were seemingly targeted for information they had shared online regarding APBn harassment of Rohingya. Sayed Hossein, 27, who works as a health volunteer with an international organization and as a citizen journalist, said that on July 25, 2022, at about 10 p.m., around 30 APBn officers arrived at his house, handcuffed him, and confiscated his laptop and flash drive. (Pseudonyms are used to protect the security of interviewees.) He said they told him he was being arrested for posting on social media about an APBn officer harassing innocent Rohingya.

606,Bangladesh,"Bangladesh: citizen journalist arrested, asked to pay bribe",26/01/2023,"Bangladesh’s Armed Police Battalion (APBn) is committing extortion, arbitrary arrests, and harassment of Rohingya refugees already facing violence from criminal gangs and armed groups, Human Rights Watch said today. Donor governments should press the Bangladesh authorities to investigate alleged abuses against Rohingya living in refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, ensure that victims have effective remedies, and develop measures to better protect refugees.

The Armed Police Battalion took over security in the Rohingya camps in July 2020. Refugees and humanitarian workers report that safety has deteriorated under the APBn’s oversight due to increased police abuses as well as criminal activity. Some refugees allege collusion between APBn officers and armed groups and gangs operating in the camps.

“Abuses by police in the Cox’s Bazar camps have left Rohingya refugees suffering at the hands of the very forces who are supposed to protect them,” said Shayna Bauchner, Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Bangladesh authorities should immediately investigate allegations of widespread extortion and wrongful detention by Armed Police Battalion officers and hold all those responsible to account.”

Human Rights Watch interviewed more than 40 Rohingya refugees in October and November 2022 and reviewed police reports, documenting more than 16 cases of serious abuse by APBn officers. These included abuses against 10 refugees who were detained on apparently fabricated grounds for trafficking yaba, a methamphetamine drug, or for violence-related offenses. Human Rights Watch and others have long documented the common practice by Bangladesh security forces of framing suspects with drugs or weapons.

Almost every case Human Rights Watch investigated involved extortion either directly by APBn officers or communicated through majhis, the camp community leaders. Police generally demanded 10,000-40,000 taka (US$100-400) to avoid arrest, and 50,000-100,000 taka ($500-1,000) for the release of a detained family member. Families often had to sell gold jewelry or borrow money for bribes or legal costs. Many worried about the harm to their reputation.

Several refugees were seemingly targeted for information they had shared online regarding APBn harassment of Rohingya. Sayed Hossein, 27, who works as a health volunteer with an international organization and as a citizen journalist, said that on July 25, 2022, at about 10 p.m., around 30 APBn officers arrived at his house, handcuffed him, and confiscated his laptop and flash drive. (Pseudonyms are used to protect the security of interviewees.) He said they told him he was being arrested for posting on social media about an APBn officer harassing innocent Rohingya. They took him to the police camp and demanded a bribe. When his family could not pay 50,000 taka ($500), the APBn officers forcibly photographed him with yaba tablets and sent him to the nearby Ukhiya police station.

“I asked them not to take any photos since it would impact my job and future,” Sayed Hossein said. “They said that because I’m Rohingya, I don’t have any future.” APBn posted the photos on their social media accounts.

In addition, conditions were added to limit excessive exposure of the body and display and sale of pornography. Lee Gye-yeol, head of the general affairs department of the Seoul Metropolitan Government, said, “Considering the purpose of creating Seoul Plaza, which is the healthy use of leisure and cultural activities, and the fact that there is a strong public opinion for and against the event, there was a consensus that a specific group cannot be allowed to occupy the plaza for six days.”

Seoul Plaza operates through a reporting system.

The fact that the report on the use of the Queer Parade Seoul Plaza was handed over to the Plaza Management Committee means that the Seoul Metropolitan Government has determined that the use of the plaza is in violation of the purpose of the plaza or restricted in accordance with other laws and regulations.

4911,Viet Nam,Vietnam: WHRD summoned after reporting police took her money,05/02/2023,"A former prisoner of conscience has been summoned by police in Vietnam after accusing them of taking nearly U.S.$11,000 from her during her arrest three years ago.

Le Thi Binh, 46, is a member of Vietnam’s Constitution Group, posting her views regularly on Facebook. She also joined protests against the draft Laws on Cybersecurity and Special Economic Zones in 2018.

She was released at the end of November after serving a two-year prison sentence allegedly “abusing democratic freedoms.”

Police in southern Vietnam’s Can Tho city brought her in for questioning Wednesday after a Facebook stream, during which Binh said officers took U.S. dollars and Vietnamese dong she was saving to renovate her home.

During the meeting, the police said that Binh's online talk on Jan. 22 contained sensitive content, affecting the reputation of state agencies, including the Binh Thuy district Police.

Binh told RFA when she was arrested on Dec. 22, 2022, police confiscated her handbag and wallet.

Binh said she told the police the money belonged to a friend who was traveling with her and assumed they would give it to the person, who was not arrested.

They later returned the handbag and wallet, which only had some small notes left in them.

""This money was definitely taken by Mr. Ky,” said Binh referring to Truong Ngoc Ky, the police officer investigating her case.

Binh said police also took money from her daughter’s wedding that was hidden in a photo album in her bedroom

Police used a hacksaw to open her door and forced her to sit on the bed while they ransacked her house, she said. The search report did not mention the missing money.

During Tuesday's meeting the police said they did not take money from her house and asked her if anyone had seen her hiding it.

Binh said state media lied when they reported on the police search, saying she had many documents with anti-state content. She said the only documents in her home were bank books and her children’s books. When she met the police, she asked them to explain where the newspapers got their information but they didn’t tell her.

In an interview with RFA Vietnamese following her release Binh talked about the harsh conditions at An Phuoc Prison camp in Binh Duong province. She said she was forced to do hard labor and fed with only two meals of rice and rotten fish a day.

Police questioned her about this during her interview and she confirmed the facts were correct.

4912,Afghanistan,"Afghanistan: prominent educator arrested, his house raided",25/04/2023,"A prominent Afghan campaigner for female education has been arrested by the Taliban, even as teenage girls and women remain barred from classrooms.

Matiullah Wesa, 30, had often received threats - he has spent years travelling across Afghanistan trying to improve access to education for all children.

The Taliban did not say why Mr Wesa is in custody. His house was also raided.

His arrest follows the detention of a number of other activists who have been campaigning for women's education.

In February Prof Ismail Mashal, an outspoken critic of the Taliban government's ban on education for women, was arrested in Kabul while handing out free books. He was freed on 5 March but has not spoken out since then.

Mr Wesa is one of the most prominent education activists in Afghanistan and, via his charity PenPath, has been campaigning for girls' right to study since the Taliban barred female education in 2021.

His last tweet - on Monday, the day of his arrest - was a photo of women volunteers for PenPath ""asking for the Islamic rights to education for their daughters"".

The UN's mission in Afghanistan has also highlighted Mr Wesa's case and called on the Taliban to clarify his whereabouts and the reasons for his detention.

Mr Wesa was arrested after he came out of a mosque in the capital Kabul on Monday.

""The Taliban came in two vehicles,"" a person close to the family told the BBC. ""He was handcuffed and put in the car.

""Today at 10am, the Taliban went to his house and raided it. They turned it upside down, threatened his family against speaking out, seized phones, documents and computers. Matiullah's brothers were briefly detained and then released with a warning.""

Mr Wesa has travelled to hundreds of districts in Afghanistan over the past decade to promote the cause of education.

The PenPath network he founded has more than 2,400 volunteers across the country. They help set up local classrooms, find teachers and distribute books and stationery.

The ban on girls attending secondary schools has not stopped Mr Wesa. ""The damage that closure of schools causes is irreversible and undeniable,"" he tweeted last week.

Women's rights have been gradually eroded since the Taliban returned to power in August 2021 following the withdrawal of US-led forces.

Only boys and male teachers were allowed into secondary schools when they reopened in September 2021.

There was a brief spell of hope following an announcement in March 2022 that girls would be allowed to attend secondary schools. But tearful schoolgirls were turned away after what appeared to be an abrupt U-turn by the Taliban leadership.

They said girls would be allowed to return to school after ""a comprehensive plan has been prepared according to Sharia and Afghan culture"". But in December 2022, female students were also barred from universities.

The Taliban say schools and universities are only temporarily closed to women and girls until a ""suitable environment"" can be created.

But women are severely curtailed in other ways too. The Taliban have decreed that women should be dressed in a way that only reveals their eyes, and must be accompanied by a male relative if they are travelling more than 72km (48 miles).

And last November, women were banned from parks, gyms and swimming pools, stripping away the simplest of freedoms. The enforcement of the rules is different in different areas, but the rules create an environment of fear and anxiety.

The restrictions have continued despite international condemnation and protests by ordinary women as well as activists speaking up on their behalf.

They have also hindered the work of foreign aid groups after the Taliban said women could not work in domestic and international NGOs except in the health sector.

Some organisations were forced to suspend services at a time when the country is reeling from a severe economic and humanitarian crisis.",Right to liberty and security
4913,Viet Nam,Vietnam: pro-democracy defender denied meeting with his lawyer (Update),02/05/2023,"The defense lawyer for ‘Onion Leaf Bae,” an activist whose online video mimicked a Turkish chef in apparent mockery of a senior government official, said he was kept from seeing his client this week.

Bui Tuan Lam, who runs a beef noodle stall in Danang, achieved some notoriety in 2021 when a video that went viral showing him imitating the Turkish chef known as Salt Bae. 

The video was widely seen as a mockery of Vietnam’s minister of public security, To Lam, who was caught on film being hand-fed one of Salt Bae’s gold-encrusted steaks – by the chef himself – at a cost of 1,450 pounds (U.S.$1,975). 

Critics wondered how the official could afford the extravagant meal on a monthly salary of $660.

In Bui’s video clip, he refers to himself as “Onion Leaf Bae” and dramatically sprinkles spring onions into a bowl of soup at his noodle stand, mimicking the signature move of the celebrity chef.

Bui was later summoned by Danang police for questioning and was arrested in September 2022. He has since been charged for violating Article 117 of the country’s Penal Code, frequently used by authorities to restrict freedom of expression and opinions deemed critical of the government.

The Danang People’s Court on Monday approved Le Dinh Viet’s registration to be Bui Tuan Lam’s lawyer for the upcoming first-instance trial. 

Viet said he then went to Danang Police’s detention facility where Bui Tuan Lam was being held, but staff didn’t allow him to see his client, saying the judge hadn’t had time to review the recently completed investigation report. 

Monitoring meetings?

He said he was told to “advise the court of the timing” of any proposed meetings with the defendant in the future so that the court could arrange for the meeting to be monitored.

The 2015 Criminal Procedure Code and the 2015 Law on Temporary Custody and Detention doesn’t have any provisions requiring prosecuting agencies to monitor meetings between defense lawyers and their clients, Viet said.

But an interagency circular from 2018 and another circular issued in 2019 by the Ministry of Public Security said prosecuting agencies can assign staff members to supervise meetings between defense lawyers and their clients if needed, he said.

Over the past 10 years of professional practice, Viet has participated in four cases related to national security. Bui’s case was the first time he was prevented from seeing a client, he said.

According to Danang People’s Procuracy’s indictment, Bui posted 19 articles on his Facebook account and 25 videos and articles on his YouTube account from April 17, 2020, to July 26, 2022. The articles and videos included content “distorting, defaming people’s government” and “fabricating and causing confusion among people.”

The link to the Facebook account alleged in the indictment to have contained the 19 articles no longer functions. There are only three videos currently on the YouTube channel allegedly used by the activist – all three were posted recently. The channel doesn’t contain the videos and posts listed in the indictment.

If convicted, Bui could receive a prison term of five to 12 years.",Right to fair trial
4914,Viet Nam,"Vietnam: scholar, former NGO staff prevented from leaving the country",03/05/2023,"Ticket in hand, Vietnamese scholar Nguyen Quang A stepped up to the immigration counter at Hanoi’s Noi Bai International Airport. 

He planned to catch a flight to Thailand, and continue onward to the European Union, where he had planned to tour several countries. 

But he was stopped by police and prevented from boarding the plane.

“I told them that it was no problem and asked them to create a record about the incident, explaining why I was banned from traveling abroad,” the former director of the now-dissolved Institute of Development Studies told Radio Free Asia.

A’s grounding is one of hundreds of documented cases of the Vietnamese government preventing social activists, political dissidents or religious freedom activists from leaving the country.

The incident report did not explain exactly why A was stopped at the airport, only saying it was on the request of the Ministry of Public Security’s Immigration Department and “related to security issues,” per Clause 9, Article 36 of Vietnam’s 2019 Law on Entry and Exit of Vietnamese Citizens. 

The report said he could inquire with the department for more information.

Prior to receiving the incident report, A had been approached by two police officers from the Ministry of Public Security, he said.

“[They] told me that the Hanoi police summoned me in late 2021 and that issue hasn’t been resolved,” said A. “I told them that I had no idea about [any summons], and that they should know more about it because they are from the same ministry. I never received any notices or summons.”

A also said he was not aware that he was in any legal trouble prior to trying to leave the country. 

The police later returned his passport and gave him a copy of the record, but they tore his boarding pass, making it impossible to request a refund from Vietnam Airlines. 

The police returned his passport and gave him a copy of the incident record. However, they tore his boarding pass, making it impossible for him to request Vietnam Airlines for a refund.

“I don’t understand why they did that,” he said. “I could ask for a refund if it was still intact. In fact, I wasn’t even in the boarding area yet.”

A said he would consider asking the Immigration Department to clearly explain the reason his exit was denied, but said an inquiry might be in vain, because the laws are so vague that they could say whatever they want.

 RFA attempted to contact the Immigration Department for an explanation but telephone calls and emails went unanswered.

Targeting scholars, lawyers and activists

A said he was deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Vietnam because several scholars like himself have been arrested, and the attorneys representing them have been harassed.

In 2022, the Vietnamese government arrested two senior scholars: Hoang Ngoc Giao, the director of the Institute for Policies, Law and Development under the Vietnam Union of Science and Technology Associations for “tax evasion,” and Nguyen Son, former director of the SENA Institute of Technology Research and Development for “abusing democratic freedoms.”

Over the past few months, the police summoned the five attorneys defending Peng Lei Buddhist Church members for alleged violations of Article 331 of the Penal Code – an article widely criticized by international communities as being vague and used to stifle dissenting voices.

In October 2018, A participated in a human rights hearing at the EU Parliament, just before the regional bloc ratified the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement. At the hearing, he requested the EU to pressure Vietnam to sign three international labor conventions, including Convention 87 which gives workers the freedom of association and to organize into independent trade unions.

Monday’s incident was not the first time he had been stopped at Noi Bai Airport. 

On Sept. 1, 2015, police at the airport took him into temporary custody after a trip to the United States, where he had participated in talks about the role of civil society in the democratization of Vietnam. He had also taken part in a summer conference in Berlin with other Vietnamese intellectuals that year. 

According to a February 2022 report by New York-based Human Rights Watch, Vietnamese authorities systematically prevented more than 170 activists, bloggers, dissidents, and their families from traveling within Vietnam or overseas. Their tactics included stopping them at airports or border gates, rejecting their applications for a passport or other travel papers.

Nguyen Quang A is a human rights defender and a prominent member of Vietnamese civil society. In 2007, he co-founded the Institute of Development Studies (IDS), an independent, non-profit think-tank, since closed, that frequently questioned the government's policies. In 2013, he co-founded the Civil Society Forum in response to Decree 72, a party document that limits online expression. The forum has, among other activities, organised protests against environmental damage and promoted the participation of independent candidates for Parliament elections. Lately, Nguyen Quang A has been extremely vocal regarding the 2016 Formosa spill, an industrial disaster which caused tens of thousands of fishermen to lose their source of livelihood.
