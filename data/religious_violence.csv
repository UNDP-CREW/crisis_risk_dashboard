Pepiliyana, Dehiwela",Colombo,NA,"Four men stood outside the house of the pastor shouting “Christian come out” while the pastor's wife and two children were alone at home. They were frightened by the shouts of the men who were threatening to kill the pastor. Receiving a phone call from his terrified wife, the pastor immediately returned home fearing for the safety of his family. A short while later he received a telephone call from the man who led the gang, threatening him with death unless he left the village by morning. He continued to harass the family with several threatening calls during the next few hours. Later that same night the same man pounded on their front door shouting abuse and threats demanding the pastor to come outside. The intruder continued his verbal abuse until the police who were called in arrived and placed him under arrest.",Unaffiliated or unidentified individual or group,Unknown or unverifiable,Intervene after the event,Absent/unknown,N/A,NA,Property Damage,Place of worship
