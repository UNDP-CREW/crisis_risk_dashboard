Adnany was subsequently brought to Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar, where she was initially denied treatment by several doctors due to her transgender identity. After 3 hours of delay, she was operated on to remove the bullet. After these events Adnany lodged a complaint with the Chamkani Police, however, at the time of writing, the police had failed to make any arrest and were allegedly instead putting pressure on her to reconcile with her attackers. Concern is expressed that the alleged threats, assassination attempt and initial denial of medical treatment are related to Adnany’s activities in defence of rights of transgender persons and her own gender identity.",Asia-Pacific Group,Asia Pacific,2,0,NA,0,0,1,health

The draft legislation could result in significant censorship of and self-censorship by the media, especially those critical of the Government and investigative journalism, and could also seriously deter whistleblowers who, by definition, reveal information of general interest by transmitting data they are not authorized to access, copy or transmit.",Asia-Pacific Group,Asia Pacific,0,1,15 Jan 2016,0,0,0,freedom of opinion and expression

Earlier that day Mr. Ahmedur Rashid Tutul, another Bangladeshi publisher, was the victim of a violent attack, which left him injured and hospitalized. Mr. Tutul had published four of Mr. Roy’s books. It is reported that the responsibility for these attacks has been claimed by the armed group Ansar al-Islam, Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS). Concern is expressed at what appears to be a pattern of violence and intimidation against secular writers, publishers, bloggers/journalists and other intellectuals in the country, ostensibly in response to the exercise of their human right to freedom of expression and freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief.

According to the information received, on 7 March 2013, Mr. Sawan Masih was detained and accused of insulting the Prophet Mohammed. On 27 March 2014, he was sentenced to death on charges of blasphemy, which does not constitute a most serious crime under international law. Mr. Masih was also ordered to pay a fine of 200,000 Pakistani rupees. The defendant repeatedly denied the charges, asserting that the false accusation was made as a result of a property dispute. Serious concern is expressed that the arrest and death sentence imposed against Mr. Masih may be part of what appears to be a growing trend of misuse of blasphemy legal provisions for personal reasons as well as their unfair and disproportionate application against members of minority groups, particularly religious minorities.",Asia-Pacific Group,Asia Pacific,1,1,16 Apr 2014,0,0,0,executions

According to the information received, Ms. Mandira Sharma and Messrs. Subodh Pyakhurel, Kanak Mani Dixit, Sushil Pyakhurel, Charan Prasai and Kapil Shrestha, all members of the Accountability Watch Committee (AWC), have been the subject of stigmatising remarks in newspapers, online news portals and on radio stations. These reports have also included calls to 'people's action' against them, understood in the Nepalese context to imply violent attacks. All these media are reportedly affiliated with a Maoist political party currently in government. It is alleged that the threats have been motivated by AWC efforts in securing the arrest in Britain of an army colonel now being investigated for torture incidents in Nepal in 2005 as well as the arrest of Maoist cadres for the murder of a journalist in 2004. Additionally, Ms. Mandira Sharma has received messages of an investigation being opened against the organisation, Advocacy Forum, of which she is the head, potentially putting its human rights activities at risk.

According to the information received, the impeachment process against the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Ms. Shirani Bandaranayake, which started when the motion was filed on 1st November 2012, is biased and arbitrary and does not respect the fundamental principles of fair trial and due process guarantees. In addition, it is reported that on 17 December 2012, a group of four unidentified men armed with automatic weapons attacked Mr. Gunaratne Waninnayaka, the president of the Colombo Magistrate's Court Lawyers' Association. On 20 December 2012, the house of the President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, Mr. Wijedasa Rajapakse, was reportedly attacked with gun fire by unknown persons. It is alleged that these attacks are directly related to the support voiced by the two lawyers and the Bar Association in favour of the independence of the judiciary, and that of the Chief Justice in particular. The impeachment of the Chief Justice and the reported attacks against prominent lawyers are allegedly taking place in a broader context of attacks on, threats to and interference in the independence of the justice system in Sri Lanka. An urgent appeal expressing serious concern about reported attacks on, threats to and interference in the independence of the justice system in Sri Lanka, including specific attacks against judges, was already sent on 2 November 2012 (see A/HRC/22/67, case no LKA 5/2012).",Asia-Pacific Group,Asia Pacific,0,1,07 Jan 2013,0,0,1,independence of judges and lawyers

According to the information received, the 2007 Constitution of Thailand contains the clause, “The King shall be enthroned in a position of revered worship and shall not be violated. No person shall expose the King to any sort of accusation or action. “Article 112 of the Criminal Code states that ‘Whoever defames, insults or threatens the King, the Queen, the Heir-apparent or the Regent, shall be punished with imprisonment of three to fifteen years”. These provisions are applied in a manner and with a frequency which raises concerns. The severity of the punishments received, the absence of exemptions on constitutional or legal grounds and the force it exerts over the judicial system adds to the chilling effect on free speech. Unlike regular defamation cases, which can only be initiated by a damaged party, lèse majesté complaints can be made by anyone in Thailand, which has resulted in a sharp increase of cases in the last years.

According to the information received, the Constituent Assembly, which was tasked with drafting a new Constitution in Nepal, was dissolved in May 2012, reportedly due to disagreements regarding the reorganization of the Nepali state under a federal structure defined along ethnic lines,  This federal structure had been supported by indigenous representatives. With the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly and the current proposals for the creation of an entirely new body to take its place, concerns have been expressed that the progress made by indigenous members of the former Constituent Assembly could be lost. In addition, as a result of ongoing disagreements over the nature of the federal structure to be established in Nepal, incidents of criminal persecution of indigenous leaders in the country have been reported. Finally, various domestic laws still require reform in order to comply with relevant international standards. This letter follows up on the recommendations made in a 2009 report of the Specail Rapporteur (A/HRC/12/34/Add.3) as well as a communication of 29 January 2010 (A/HRC/15/37/Add.1).",Asia-Pacific Group,Asia Pacific,0,1,04 Apr 2013,1,0,0,indigenous peoples

According to the information received, law enforcement authorities have repeatedly used excessive force against peaceful demonstrators protesting against the increase of fuel prices, the Employees’ Pension Benefits Fund Bill, and alleged attacks against women belonging to minorities by the military. Human rights and political activists were also prevented by law enforcement authorities from participating in a peaceful protest organized by a platform of civil society organizations working on cases of disappearances and abduction. Media organizations staging a peaceful protest which called for the authorities to investigate into attacks over the past years on media personnel and institutions, were forced to change the venue of their protest, whereas counter-protestors (pro-government groups), some armed with clubs, could demonstrate at the initial venue.  Reportedly, the military unduly requires advance notification prior to any meetings, and attends meetings to which it was not invited with a view to intimidating the participants.
